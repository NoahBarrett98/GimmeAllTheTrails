{"/trail/canada/nova-scotia/cape-split-trail": {"written": ["Great", "Did this hike on September 11th. First off, Alltrails is not up to date. The hike is now a loop as they've added an entire new section along the other side of the Cape. You can still do it as an out and back if you like but the new part has several new look offs added so I would recommend doing the loop. The loop itself is about 13k but with the added treks to the look offs it's probably more like 14-14.5k if you do the loop and look offs.\n\nWhen we arrived the parking lot was jam packed so be aware that if you're going there on the weekend and the weather is nice, it will be packed...and I mean packed.\n\nWe went to the point on the old trail and returned on the new trail. The old trail was extremely muddy so if you go after a rain, waterproof footwear is recommended. The trail was the same as the parking lot...busy. I'm not a fan of crowded hiking trails so I don't find that very enjoyable.\n\nWhen we reached the point it was crazy windy...like difficult to stand up windy. The views from the point are nothing short of spectacular.\n\nWe returned on the new trail which is slightly longer than the old trail to the point. Part of the reason for this is the trail is extremely curvy, winding through the woods. To the point that at times it actually seems unnecessary. But it is a nice trail with less mud then in the way in, but muddy non the less.\n\nThe look offs are a nice addition but are a bit disappointing when you get to them given the extra distance to reach them (3 in total although one was not completed when we were there). ", "Great", "The new loop makes the hike definitely longer, but it's nice to have a change in scenery and the new lookoff spots. I went after the rain, and the new path was almost as muddy as the old path. There was a lot of people on the trails too - never seen it so busy in the past.", "Lovely views at the point, however the majority of the hike is forested without views. The trail was also very busy (Saturday). With the new loop the trail is 13.3km plus going to the viewpoint at the middle makes it more like 14km. If you don't want that long of hike, you can definitely find similar views on shorter hikes. ", "Love the new addition to make this a loop with some great lookoffs.  The new/lower trail was extremely mucky and made it a little trickier but 10/10 recommend this trail!", "Very muddy on lower trail/ upper not too bad", "Love the loop. Great look offs. Really nice trail experience improvements!", "Beautiful trail. Walked it today after a downpour and it was very muddy and slick the majority of the way. The new loop was much less muddy, so would recommend that route.", "Nice trail, very hot today, so turned around after 3km in.", "Beautiful drive to the trail. The trail was somewhat hilly and rooty but fairly easy. Several muddy sections even after a dry August. The top is amazing and there are a few other pretty look offs as well. It took me 3 hours to go out and back.", "Beautiful trail, largely shaded until you get to the tip. Main trail is muddy in several places, as noted by several reviewers, so be prepared! New \u201cloop\u201d much less muddy and has several look off points which are beautiful and worth stepping of the trail to see! Bring lots of water!! Definitely worth the effort and would do it again in a heartbeat!", "Amazing views. A few muddy spots but well worth it. ", "The trail is in good condition. 13km total round trip. The first 2km are the elevation, the rest is fairly flat. The views are very rewarding. Would advise going early in the morning as the traffic seemed to increase at around noon.  We were on the trail at 7 am, no one else out there. ", "Excellent trail.  New section is very nice addition.  ", "New trail is great. Muddy in areas, but trail is new. Great lookoff spots along the way.", "Big rain the day before but great sunny day for our hike the day after. Trail was muddy in many places from the rain. Worth the walk once you get to see the view!", "Super muddy conditions this weekend. But overall a great trail. Very busy on the weekends, start early to get a parking spot. ", "Beautiful day out there! VERY muddy trail conditions right now - make sure to dress for it :)", "The ending makes this trail totally worth it! We went for sunset and the trail is clear enough easily manage with headlamps or flashlights. ", "Great hike.  Took a little under 4 hours. Better in hiking boots than shoes.", "Muddy in some spots. Bring a backpack with a picnic lunch and water and you\u2019re all set. Definitely worth it! We did it in just under 4 hours in and back ", "Super busy on a long weekend. But v lovely.", "WELL worth it! It\u2019s a bit taxing early on, as you\u2019ll do most of the incline within the first 2 km or so. From there, muddy puddles regularly occur, most of which are easy to walk around via an outer edge, others requiring a bit more fun, careful planning (be careful - it can be slick if you attempt to hop over any portion, and you may take a \u201cbanana peel\u201d spill). I found it quite fun, kinda of like a video game in dodging these little obstacles (felt like playing Crash Bandicoot to be specific. Anyhow, the view from the top is one of the most vast, amazing panoramas I\u2019ve ever seen in my life!! It was so windy up there that you could almost lean forward and have it hold you upright. The walk back is much easier, as all of that ascension early on is downhill on the way out. This one is an absolute must-do!\n\nAlso - I didn\u2019t encounter a single bug. Hiked it early August on a sunny morning 9:00-12:30.", "Excellent trek through the woods. It was raining H.A.R.D. the day we went but that didn\u2019t take away from the hike\u2026 great views at the end with one other look-off to the right as you go in.  Well worth the walk.", "Nice moderate trail. Not too steep but there is some muddy stretches at the beginning (even on a sunny, dry day. View at the end of the cape makes for a satisfying midpoint but perhaps doesn\u2019t justify the hike on its own.", "Great views from the lookout midway to the end of the point", "Superbe randonn\u00e9e\n", "Trail is very wet in some places. Nice easy hike.", "It was pretty muddy so wear proper  shoes.  Spectacular view for a picnic at the end", "Heavily treed, creeks running through paths, mucky and challenging at times with hills. Worth the view. Waterproof boots recommended. 9/10", "Awesome", "Great hike, the trail was quite wet so wear appropriate footwear.  The new path isn't open as of July 15, I would be very surprised if it is open by the end of the summer.  Great views on the top.", "Great hike\u2026not overly difficult (just long), easy to follow, trail goes through woods until it opens to a beautiful vista at the end. New loop trail still not open. Some muddy areas but fairly easy to navigate around them.", "well marked along the trail with how far you are. ", "Really really lovely. Warm in the trees but the view at the end is well worth it", "I admit, this ranks first on my list of hikes to date. This is one of Nova Scotia\u2019s majestic gems, overlooking the Bay of Fundy. The tidal action here is impressive. The trail is 12.1 km out and back, between 3 - 5 hours. We spent most of our time admiring the view and had a mini picnic with a beautiful view.", "Trail is mostly dry with very few bugs but many hikers! New look off deck is lovely. The trails for new loop are not open and are taped off.   Sunny most of the way but unfortunately foggy at the point. Will try again another time but a wonderful trail nonetheless. ", "great hike. super foggy at the end. ", "A long hike! Trail is covered in shade\ufffc. Great workout the first 20 minutes is rocky and a lot of up hill. Definitely worth it yeah ", "Great! frist time won't be the last! went with my brother and Luna. trail was in great shape 2 hrs in at an easy going pace. 3 hours out. massive amount of people. nice day. We went in early and coming out tge cars were lined down the road with tge parking lot cramed. traffic the only reason not 5/5 views and hike are spot on fir a day hike. and dine by noon ", "Spectacular dramatic exhausting", "A bit muddy and be for quite a long trek up hill. Well worth it though. Beautiful!", "Hard pack with some wet spots. A blast of a trail to run. Some nice speedy sections. Absolutely stunning view at the turn around. ", "Amazing.", "great easy to follow trail. bit muddy in spots, and good boots are definitely a plus.\n\n ", "The new loop is still rough and closed. Adds 3K and lots of rollers!", "Great trail for a late morning hike. Pack a lunch to eat when you\u2019re at the top! Perfect picnic spot, although it can be windy.", "Excellent trail conditions today, almost all dry, very few mucky spots. The new trail on the Scots Bay side is not yet opened; park staff told us the projected opening is not until August.", "The trail was in great condition after the winter. A little bit muddy today, but only near the front end of the trail. I was happy to see new offshoots from the main trail (official, not footpaths) including a new look off!", "A beautiful trail at any hour of any season. The trail is hard-packed dirt, so even if it might get a bit muddy, it\u2019s never too deep or unnavigable.\n\nThe seagulls roosting on the furthest outcropping are a beautiful sight when they wake up and start to stretch their wings.", "Really well signposted, but also well trodden so you can\u2019t go wrong. A great hike on a lovely sunny day!", "Great hike. Beautiful view. The first km or a bit more is wet still this spring. Otherwise perfect!", "Nice hike, a bit muddy as the snow has just melted.\ufffc we only did the 1st part.", "Super muddy trail but completely worth it to make it to the end.", "Beautiful views and awesome place to bring your furry friend! Was pretty icy during the hike, so would definitely recommend as a summer/late fall adventure! ", "Really great trail.  A little icy this time of year so some sort of traction for your shoes is a good idea.", "We hiked on Jan 16 and the trail was in great condition! Only 1 section about 1-2k in that was icy, the rest was just nicely packed snow, great traction.  Awesome day! ", "The trail was quite icy in places, and wet and muddy in others, but this didn\u2019t seem to deter anyone as there was a fair amount of traffic on this beautiful winter day.", "Minimal ice, great day out!", "Lovely trail with an absolutely stunning view at the end of the peninsula. Well worth it. \n\nVery touristy and busy on weekends. If you want a quieter hike, weekday mornings are best for this one. ", "It's a long walk, took me about 3 hours one way, but well worth it!  The trail itself was in good condition with roots and rocks exposed but a good mix between uphill and level with 2 look out points before arriving at the end. One bathroom due to Covid.\n", "Only mucky in a couple spots. They are building some new lookoffs. Perfect temperature: 15c.", "Great hike! Had a beautiful day!", "Great spot", "Breathtaking.", "Great! Slow and steady until the end", "Mind breaker", "A bit muddy on some parts but it was to be expected after heavy rains the day before.  Beautiful scenery from the top not much to see on the way up. Worth bring a snack to sit and take in the view.", "Great hike. Very busy spot today as its a long weekend but people were very curious and kept distance as much as possible. Will be back. ", "Fantastic", "Highly recommend this trail! Easy to moderate hiking. \n", "Easy hike. Only scenery was at the end", "Moderate trail, the view at the end of the trail is breathtaking. ", "Well kept trail! Beautiful views!

", "great trail!! we took both our dogs (collie & chi) and they loved it. couple must spots but easily walked around. the lookout was busy but stunning views! ", "Great hike day today. Trail is in great shape - the few mucky spots from recent rain are all passable by going around the puddles. No damage or impassable spots to report. ", "Recommend the trek up and back. Don\u2019t go do the loop. Too bushwacky so difficult for what it\u2019s worth.", "Very nice trail! Fairly busy, but well kept. Entire trail is forested, so it's nicely shaded and keeps the wind out. After an hour or so, we made it to the end and BOOM! Gale force winds when we reached the opening to the Split. Probably so windy that it limited our stay to about 15 minutes, so we hiked 'er back. All in all, took around 2h15m to complete at a pretty decent pace. Definitely recommend this trail, though! Surrounding area of Wolfville is always a nice stay, as well. Terrific area.", "Amazing hike. Busier than I expected but lovely. Tough in places. The view at the point is breathtaking!", "I did this trail in June 2020, it was excellent! Took my 2 dogs, lots of water. the trail was beautiful and the view at the end was spectacular. would definately recommend this trail. ", "Great trail, amazing views. Some steep inclines and a long trek but in the end, it\u2019s worth it", "Great trail well maintained.  Not too difficult terrain.  Took us 3 hours round trip ", "Beautiful view. Clear trail, not too busy when we went and didn\u2019t run into any bugs", "Well maintained", "First time doing a hike. Went with my nieces and a friend. First of all, I have lower back issues, being a person that loves a challenge. I decided to wear my 10lb vest. Thought it was a 2.5 hr walk in and out! NO!  Realized we were in for a very long hike. I was hurting so bad by the time we got to the split. It was definitely worth every bit of pain that I encountered! We sat and ate lunch. Took beautiful pictures. It was difficult going  back. Feet were feeling pain. But I wouldn't change a thing.....now I'm in love with hiking!!", "Nice easy walk. Mostly up grade to the end, wide path, some roots and rocks to stumble over. Lots of parking and bathrooms at the beginning and half way point.", "Whew! Hiked Cape Split in May and it was a great adventure. The forest is beautiful, lots of plants and flowers, and you get little peeks of the ocean through the trees. Very peaceful and dreamy. And then the end!! Super climactic, especially on a windy day. I came through the trees and then BAM blasted by wind. My cheeks were flappin! So fun! \n\nAlso! I encourage you to look up the Indigenous histories and presents of the land you\u2019re hiking on. Think about what it means as settlers to use this unceded Mi\u2019kmaq land for pleasure. ", "Great hike. Watch the weather as it can be windy and foggy at the split while being sunny in the parking lot", "Great view at the end. It was a little muddy in places but overall really well kept.", "Amazing. It was an easy trail.", "Beautiful trail. The hike is mainly in the woods and there are some very steep inclines. None of the 12km has a view of the basin or Bay of Fundy, but the view at the end is spectacular. The actual hiking trail is beautiful but is 100% forest. The paths are narrow so passing people doesn\u2019t allow for the \u2018Covid 6ft\u2019. There are some washrooms at the start of the trail and half way up. The half way up ones are in the shade so smelt slightly better on a hot day! :) ", "Great day on the trail. Lots of hills and a beautiful view. \nShould have benches for people to stop and rest and snack.  ", "Challenging but well maintained and marked path. Definitely worth the view!", "Took 4.5 hours (including exploring the cape, and having a snack) with a 9 year old that does not hike. Worth it, amazing view!", "It was a great to do this trail again although it felt a bit longer than I remember. Very quiet, went on a Wednesday afternoon.  ", "Great Hike... Easy to hike... well maintained! view at the end is just amazing!", "Beautiful reward at the end. Mostly wooded and hilly trail to get there but well maintained. Loop at the end is not a part of the official trail and is overgrown in parts. Try going on a clear day. ", "what a great trail. busy but lots to look at.", "Awesome hike today but watch out for the tree you have to duck under... I wasn\u2019t so fortunate and ended up hitting my head", "Wonderful hike, slightly busy. Beautiful view at the top and lots of grass to sit for some food.\nA bit of a rocky climb at the beginning but overall not too hard of a hike.\nMy phone died when we were at the top eating so this record is half the hike.", "Awesome Hike. More on the easier side of moderate. Worth doing the loop at the end. Nice and isolated from the wind and sun. \n\nWindy at the cape split look off. Bring a jacket. \n\nYou can take a little trail down to the water by holding on to a sketchy rope. \n\nTook about 3hrs of moving time including the dip down to the waterfront from the loop. \n\nWould Love to come back and trail run the out and back. ", "Foggy today but still a fantastic hike. Took about 3.5 hrs ", "One of our favorite hikes in Nova Scotia.  Hiked it today, including the little loop along the south side.  Lots of blowdown from last fall on that little stretch.  Beautiful!", "Nice trail, ran about half of it, I'm sure it's a nice view at the end, unfortunately it was really foggy for us.", "Super nice trail!! Took us 2 hours and a bit to complete the whole trail and return to the parking lot. We ran the last couple kilometres which made the return trip take about 45 minutes and the trip up to the peak was about 1.15 hours. The trees provide some shade but sunscreen and bug spray is a must! A bit muddy at the beginning of the trail but dry after he first 2 k", "awesome trail! it\u2019s a pretty easy one, just straight up and then straight down. trail was very wide and well maintained. it was windy but it was great because it kept the bugs off! dogs loved it even on the leash. 12k felt like nothing, took us about 3.5 hours to do it not including the lunch break we took at the top, and a few water breaks. ", "We hiked this trail yesterday and the flowers were beautiful! Loads of trillium. The downside was it was a busy day on the trail. 50 cars in the lot when arrived at noon. Because of the pandemic and social distancing it was not a good experience. Most of the hikers were collage age adults and were hiking in groups and walking abreast making it hard to pass at a 6 foot distance , so we were forced to step off the trail when we met them. They did not offer to step off for us. The older hikers that we met did step off the trail when meeting us. We counted 118 people while we were hiking. Also garbage has been left to pile up beside the garbage bins even though parks have stated they are not doing garbage collection there at this time. A great hike but not worth the risk at this time ", "Very windy once you\u2019re at the top, the view is amazing at the end! Definitely one of the longer hikes I\u2019ve been on in awhile but already can\u2019t wait to go again, all around great trail", "Completed this one in 2014 and is one of my all-time favourites. The 12km is pretty steady and not too difficult terrain-wise. The view at the end is inxredible; definitely bring your cameras! ", "Awesome trail with incredible views. There is a decent climb over the first 2km or so but otherwise the trail is moderate to easy. \n\nWe completed the loop at the end of the trail - and that I would not recommend for the less experienced hiker. There are a couple bonus views, but the trail is very overgrown and has a lot of trees down, making it hard to keep on trail in places. It\u2019s best done as an out and back trail unless you\u2019re looking for a challenge.", "Went on a cloudy day , the trail was not so hard and the view at the end was definitely worth it. But the wind was wild, have felt wind this strong in my life. Be extra careful while at the edge of the cliff.", "Nice easy trail. I did it when it was a bit cold on 19th March 2020 so the mud was frozen. very nice view at the end. ", "Every time of year has its perks. Every time of day has its perks. A busy area, but a classic. ", "Snow over ice on the trail made it easy to hike. Lots of water views through the bare trees. Windy and frigid at the point so couldn\u2019t stay there long. A beautiful trail any season.", "a friend and I hiked this a few yrs ago..its was a blast we geocached in so took us a bit longer..alday adventure..we loved it", "Very muddy, adds time to your estimate because some areas are slow to get through with slippery spots. Leave enough time to get out before dark. We will be back again", "Hiked 11/3/19. Epic overlook, but relatively boring and crowded hike to get to it. Hiked early, and saw no one on the hike out, but there were a handful of people at the overlook and many heading in as we hiked out. There were currently some muddy sections and downed trees in the trail, but all are easily navigable. The view at the end makes this hike worth it. \nI\u2019m confused by the reviews saying it took an hour or 2. It is over 8 miles (4 each way). ", "Lovely trail. With a great reward at the end of a wonderful view but there may be crowds including dogs. Oct 20th the  outhouses part way along were locked down that is not noted on the sign at the trailhead.", "Great trail. Only one tree left on the trail from the hurricane. Very unhappy about all the tissue and toilet paper along the trail. PLEASE walk off the trail to do your business and bag your tissue to take out. Think of the other users.", "Nice trail with amazing seaside view", "love cape split, one of my favourites! i\u2019ve done it a few times and loved every minute. last time it took just over and hour to walk, can\u2019t wait to go back.", "It\u2019s an ok hike...I probably wouldn\u2019t repeat it.", "Decent Saturday afternoon outing, took my partner and I 2 and a bit hours including a short stop at the point. Very busy and very mild trail. ", "We did the entire trail (minus the loop) in three hours. Quite easy getting around the muddy spots. View at the tip worth the hike.", "muddy. only complaint.", "Typically a very busy trail - but there is lots of room at the end to look around. Bring a sweater if you intend on staying for a bit at the look off part, it's always windy and little cooler there compared to the hike in from the parking lot", "I am happy to have done this hike. The view at the end is amazing and I'm happy I got to get out there to enjoy it in person. I am very impressed with how quick the storm damage (Dorion 2019) was cleared off the trail I would say right up to the 5 km mark there were obvious signs of work that had been done to remove giant trees and logs Dorian left in the way. Navigation and Terrain wise I would put this on the easier end of hikes, length and a couple of heart rate raising hills do definitely push it to the moderate rating it but for my self I guess you could say I was slightly underwhelmed with it as far as a challenge goes but everything else was fantastic. Probably wouldn't drive the hour and a half to make this a regular hike but again happy to have done and will likely do again if in the area or the opportunity came up. ", "Fantastic hike any time of day you start it. Trail is easy to follow. Expect mud, roots and rocks. I hiked solo and with 20 mins at the top I clocked 2.5hours. I was able to do this hike in trail running shoes. There\u2019s elevation gain in the beginning then  flat and rolling and back to very flat along the ridge. Great day! Started at 2pm out by 4:30pm 9/20/19. Love it!!!", "went the day after hurricane dorian.", "Lots of roots, watch your footing!", "The loop trail was very overgrown. Wear appropriate clothing and footwear. The beach is well worth a visit though", "wear good shoes and be prepared for mud! But so worth it!

Hiked in August and was busy, on and off leash dogs and a bit of mud but navigable.", "Hiking, rock climbing, and walking the beach, all within one hours hike.", "just over 6km to the viewpoint, we got there at sunset and the sights were amazing. The loop at the end is possible to travel however it's not really maintained (overgrown , fallen trees, etc..) its much easier to go out the way you came in. there was a little bit of mud in some spots but there always seems to be an alternate route to get around it.", "what a view! the trail is amazing, it took us about 4 hours to complete. 6kms each way and a break to take in the stunning views at the end. proper footwear is necessary; we went ealier in the summer and there was quite a bit of mud & water in spots. bring a camera :)", "Well maintained trail- great out and back with incredible views at the end! Enjoyed it very much.", "The trail is a little over 6km in each direction, so over 12km total. I was walking a very brisk pace and was able to get to the end in a little over an hour. Stayed at the end for about a half hour and took me about an hour and 15 mins to walk back. So overall I clocked in at less than 3 hours. The path is pretty much boring woods the entire way until the end, but the end is pretty fabulous!  I would not recommend this trail for small kids, or at least be prepared for it to take quite a while. Weather was perfect the day I went and it hadn\u2019t rained for a few days before, so there wasn\u2019t much mud at all.

Some mud from rain 1.5 days ago. \nThe extra loop at the end does exist, but it is very overgrown, you\u2019ll get scratches from bushes ect, but it a fun adventure! No steep incline like shown in the elevation map, but still more difficult than mail trail. Views not as good either.", "A good long hike that features a pleasant forest walk along a well-maintained trail and spectacular views at the end of the cape. We took a deliberate but unhurried two hours to reach the end of the cape, an hour for lunch and to enjoy the sights, and two hours to walk back. Well worth the effort.

At the end, the snow was almost gone; we had extreme wind, though.  I'll definitely run it again!", "I did it twice. Once in July 2018 and the second time was in October 2018. It was much more enjoyable in October because I was essentially the only one climbing up and didn't see anyone else on my way down. It was also much cooler and the trees were so pretty. I took so many pictures. It took me about 2h30 there and back and I was going at a normal pace. I am not an experienced hiker and I was able to do it ", "Love the view!", "Great hike, quite windy and rugged at the point made for a bit of a thrill looking over the cliffs!", "The view is totally worth the hike. The lookout at the end makes you feel like you are on the edge of the world. Make sure to take your time and soak in the views.", "Amazing views!! A must see, beautiful trail.", "Excellent hike,  not too hard and awesome view at the end. Also opportunity to take side trail to little split and do some rick hunting in beach or just enjoy walking on a beach where later 40-45 feet of water is.", "The complete hike is in the woods with little to no view until you reach the end, which the view at the end is overrated. Also, be prepared for crowds.", "Great view well worth the Hike !!!", "I run this spring and fall each year. Fantastic trail with an iconic NS review. For trail runners, it\u2019s generally moderate difficulty with a few more technical spots and lots of exposed rocks and roots-broke my toe on the way in a few years ago. A moderate effort will get you there and back in 1.5 hrs. You can really fly on the way back to the trailhead!", "Hiked the Split with friends who were visiting NS. Trail was in good condition although some mud and water in places. Hard packed with roots and rocks. In the trees for most of the hike and then arrive in the meadow overlooking Cape Split. Awesome view when you arrive particularly if the tide is flowing hard in one direction. We do this hike every year. Total hiking time approx 2;45 at a moderate pace.", "Nice easy hike on a foggy day. The entire hike is through the trees until the very end.", "Great hike for those of us who r not true hikers! Some hills for sure but lots of flats as well.  Just wooded views on entire trail ending with wonderful views.", "Beautiful vistas at end of the trail!", "First hike in decades! It was great! We plan to do it again in the Fall.", "This trail has enough challenging parts to make it worthwhile. I actually completed it twice in one day, back to back in 5 hours and 5 minutes.", "A nice walk through the woods. I took my 9  and 11 year old boys. They were tired at the end but enjoyed the walk. Went on a Sunday and there were quite a few fellow hikers. I\u2019d recommend going during the week if you enjoy solitude. Of the 12+ km\u2019s i\u2019d say half was uphill. Lots of stones and roots to be mindful of. A bit muddy in spots. Nice view at the end.", "Walked this trail yesterday with a couple of my friends. None of us are hikers by any means. The moderate difficulty is definitely reasonable\u2014 my non-hiker body is quite tired and sore the day after, and my friends and I took several breaks throughout. We took about four hours total. We\u2019re from Halifax, so it was about an hour and a half drive to get there\u2014 fun little roadtrip if you\u2019re from the city! The first half of the hike is quite hilly, but it flattens out during the latter half. View at the end is well worth the hike, in my opinion! I\u2019d highly suggest bug repellant of some sort, especially during this time of year. All in all, I would wholeheartedly recommend it!", "This is a nice undulating hike thru natural forest. The actual Cape Split was well worth the hike. \nIt took us 3hrs round trip and enjoyed the plentiful greenery and the beautiful vista at the point.", "Your average Canadian Forest hike for the most part, but it ends on an amazing view.  The local Chipmunks were also super friendly, allowing me to get some great shots of them.", "This trail has been on my \u201chikes to do\u201d list for years, but I always kept putting it off. The views at the end always intrigued me, but the descriptions/review of the actual hike always sounded less than exciting. I envisioned it to be too easy, I prefer a more challenging hike, but in the end, the hike was good, it had a couple good inclines and lots of roots and rocks to avoid. It\u2019s a long trek though,  we moved fairly quickly and it took us 2.5 hrs, but it probably takes most people 3-4 hrs. Bring a sweater for the end, it\u2019s damn cold out there! It was 30 degrees in Wolfville, 19 in the parking lot, but it felt like maybe 4 degrees at the end with that wind whipping at us. All in all, it wasn\u2019t my favourite hike, I\u2019m glad I did it, finally, but I probably won\u2019t do it again.", "A little underwhelming after all of the stellar reviews. The clearing is lovely and offers a nice view, however it\u2019s a bit of a trot for such little payoff. It took us an hour and 45 mins to do the first half and and an hour and 15 back at a moderate pace.", "Hiked several times while at university. Great in spring, summer and fall", "My wife and I where here in February, great hike! Super well kept and clean. Washrooms located at the entrance were open. Spectacular views!!", "Big payoff!", "Simply Beautiful.", "Trail is mostly in the woods the entire time. Not alot of trail markers, but it's easy enough to follow. No viewpoints till you reach Cape Split. Can get really icy if you're there really early in the year, and because of the ice build up, it'll remain muddy later than you would think. \r\nI'd recommend doing it to say you've done it, due to the popularity of it, ", "A great 3 hour workout with a great prize view over parts of the Bay Of Fundy at the very end.  At times, it feels like it's uphill both ways.  Very popular.  Wonderful time.", "The hike took 2.5 hours one way. Some steep areas and glimpses of the water as you approach the end. Beautiful view at the end. Pack a snack and sit down and enjoy the beautiful view!", "Great hike with amazing coastal views!!", "Went on a Saturday morning and it was definitely crowded. It's not a hard hike but there isn't too much to see on the way up. The view at the end was better than expected!", "great hike, beautiful view ! wear boots it's muddy folks!", "A great hike, moderately challenging, well maintained trail. Only upset was how cloudy and misty it was, was unable to see the whole view at the end, but it added a mysterious vibe to the hike! Still worth it!", "Great trail with an amazing view at the end!", "You have to go to the beach :D Best part of this trail!", "Amazing for us and our dog!", "nice run ending with spectacular view", "Loved this hike! The wooded area and forest was enchanting; old growth, trilliums, carpet of May flowers, moss and cool towering trees were a highlight. The end was magnificent, especially in the waining light.", "This hike was more than I ever imagined\nIt took approximately one hour to hike up the trail with no break. When you get to the top of the trail and see the view, you are in awe. I would recommend anyone to do it. Take your time and be prepared, bring a snack and something to drink.\nYou are definitely going to want to stay for a while ", "Very popular now and suggest going early. Also, walk in is about 2hrs through woods. only the end has views.", "Great trail. Give 4 to 5 hours for return. Stay away from the cliff edge at the end.. Awesome views.", "Amazing trail. Not too hard. Amazing view from the top", "Fantastic trail. Did this multiple times. Even once with infant carriers front and back. The view is always better then expected. Could be super dangerous at the end if not careful. Just stay clear from the edge and enjoy. Easy hike", "The five stars are for the view you are rewarded during this hike/walk. The view was spectacular! The hike there was more of a nice and easy walk, would make for a great jog/trail run.", "Nice easy trek with a spectacular view at the end.  More of a nature walk than a hike, with a wide, well cleared and groomed trail from start to finish. If you have time it's worth following the smaller, more rugged trail down the hill from the look off. It eventually leads to a lovely rocky beach that's often pretty empty, even on nice days when the rest of the trail is packed.", "easy hike on the main path with a fantastic view at the end. there is a large grassy look off at the end perfect for a picnic. I haven't looked for the 2nd path yet, where does it start?", "One of the great hikes in Nova Scotia, amazing view out at cape split. The trip is one everyone should make at least once in their lifetime. For a more advanced hike check out the amethyst Cove hike which vears off of the cape split trail. Always check tide times when exploring the bay of fundy before exploring the beach. Cape split is always a great hike and very much worth the long walk.", "Awesome hike! There is a choice of trails to get to the split one takes you through the woods along an up and down footpath of on even ground with roots, rocks and tree branches everywhere. The other trail takes you along the shore and is not easy. It takes you along some very narrow footpaths that are near the edge of a very steep drop to a certain death!! Once you reach the end at Cape Split you will be amazed!! Beautiful Beautiful Beautiful views!! This is a must joke for all hikers in Nova Scotia. Make a day of it and be safe!!", "Great Winter Hike, beware lot's of tree roots and rocks on the trail. Great views across to Parsboro and  the Bay. Well worth the hike to see the view at the end. Spectacular as the tide is going out. Must be beautiful in summer."], "key_words": [["Hiking"], ["Hiking", "Muddy"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking", "Muddy"], ["Hiking", "Muddy"], ["Hiking", "Muddy"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"],

Only complaint is that we didn\u2019t bring bug spray and that was a mistake \u2014 we couldn\u2019t really enjoy the view because we were being eaten alive by mutant mosquitos. Nonetheless, the view is spectacular.", "We did the loop in a clockwise direction, it\u2019s probably a little easier this way as you can step up the big rock ledges.

I say this because other trails may have near equal views (Skyline), this has a much more authentic hiking and mountaintop feel. If you were to ask me which one I prefer between Franey and Skyline, it is Franey by far. This is a true Hiker's afternoon/day Trail with multiple amazing views.

First time seeing trilliums in Nova Scotia!", "Close to home and a nice middle of the road hike on the family of Bluff Trails.  Prefer to hike it spring and fall as it can get quite busy during the summer (even on week days).  Nice mix of rock face and forest.  The signage that differentiates the 3 trails that start at the same spot can be a bit confusing once in the woods so note the colour of your trail ticket (you will see these along the routes).  Great views along the hike.  The lake it runs along is swimmable (watch for leeches- bring salt if you plan to take a dip- the just lake entrance is a bit further down the walking trail past the mouth of the Bluff trail system.  There are \u201ckeep dogs on leash sings\u201d but tbh many people let the puppers off once the hike starts which does not seem to bother most people (in my experience).\nEnjoy it\u2019s worth the time.\nHappy Hiking ", "Younger folks seemed to skip along. Lots of roots and rocks to clambake over. Mid point overlooking valley is a windy spectacle. Our dog loved it. Good hike just seemed more demanding than other times. ", "A good, close to Halifax hike. Took me around 2 hours from my car around the loop, and back to my car. The trail was in good condition, with lots of good spots to take a rest or stop for a sip of water. Only ran into a handful of people on the trail.", "Beautiful day to get out - trail was in great shape, not too busy, and was good to get some sun before all the blackflies are out.", "The last loop is a heat trap but other than that absolutely amazing", "Beautiful wilderness especially once you get far enough in that you don\u2019t hear the highway.", "Always a great trail! It was drier than I expected but there was a lot of mud and some very icy patches. Icy areas were very obvious, so take it slow mainly around the canoe portages and around the brook crossing.", "It was very cool to listen to the icy lake cracking and groaning as the temperature rose. The trail itself is bare in some spots, muddy in a couple of spots but mostly icy. If you have cleats, definitely wear them today and probably for the next couple days as well.", "This was our first time on this trail and we really enjoyed it, had some great views, good exposed rock sections and some nice areas for taking a break or a picnic if we so chose. The dog was tired at the end, so that's a win, always love a loop and nice that you can continue on to further loops if you have the time. We will definitely be back to do the longer loops - but maybe in the summer. It was verrrrry icy today, some really tight slick spots on some of the hills and both my husband and I took a couple spills, despite being fairly experienced hikers. Definitely took longer than it normally would, having to take a good chunk of time navigating the plentiful icy sections. But it was a fun adventure anyways and a beautiful day otherwise! ", "what a beautiful place. ice grippers are highly recommend right now. ", "Love this trail. It\u2019s a great hike, lots of variation in the terrain and lots of up and down. Look offs are stunning. Lots of ice today and some muddy spots but overall great! ", "Great trail! It\u2019s a great length for a hike, it takes about 2 hours to complete the loop. It\u2019s heavily used- lots of people and dogs share the trail, so it\u2019s well worn and easy to keep on trail. ", "Icy but nice ", "Great trail. Multiple trails in the area.

If you are uncomfortable with dogs, this is not a good trail for you when it's busy. Despite signs, the majority of dog owners are not respecting them.", "Absolutely beautiful! So many views and super colorful tree trunks.\nLots of small hills and rocks to climb over. Plan on going back to do the other trails soon!", "Very nice in the snow.  We started with snow shoes, but took them off part way through.", "Fantastic day out there.  Just a little muddy. Lots of company.", "Very busy day, a little muddy on some parts of the trail", "Well traveled and easy to follow trail.

It\u2019s not much longer than the second loop. Cramped calf muscle slowed me towards the end but other than that all good.", "Did this trail with a couple day 1s for my birthday. The weather wasn\u2019t great but neither were the views. Not saying the views weren\u2019t nice but it didn\u2019t need to be nice out in order to get the full effect. Lots of exposed roots and rocks but it made it that much more entertaining and exciting. Wear the proper footwear, my friend didn\u2019t and it almost resulted in a broken face. Took us around 1H 45M give or take but we also ran off and on. The perfect birthday trail if you ask me. ", "Nice trail with some wonderful views of Cranberry Lake.  Took us about  3 hours. Lots of exposed roots and rocks ", "Never disappoints!", "Ran the bluff loop. First time. A bit hit in some areas. Definitely need water if you do this.", "This was a nice diversion along the Bluff Trail. In 2019, we did the large loop outside of Pot Lake and it needed a little prep work (drink and snacks) on a hot day.

In our case it took closer to three hours.", "Just did the length of Cranberry Lake and back on the Pot Lake Loop, aprox 7.5km. Pretty straightforward, lots of exposed roots and low rocks to hop over and through. no high elevations but a few areas where you could get a breeze. moderately busy this weekday, all dogs (maybe 5 or 6) were leashed. excellent signage.", "This is one of the best hikes near Halifax.  Parking is a bit limited at the trail head so best to go before 11am on weekends.  It's a bring in pack out trail so make sure to have a backpack with you.  The trail offers fantastic views throughout and at the furthest point you'll be rewarded with expansive views of the lakes.  Nice flat rocks atop for lunch or snacks.  We went mid June and the bugs were not noticeable at all.", "Did this trail with my partner and four year old son. We had a great time! A few falls by our little guy but he plowed through. GORGEOUS views and scenery, a few flat Ricky areas to stop for snacks or breaks. we took lots. recommend for sure!", "Great trail. A little muddy in spots after being dry for a few days but easily avoidable. The trail was pretty busy on Tuesday and I chose to do it counter clockwise so we met lots of groups. I was alone for the first half though which was awesome. ", "Really enjoyed the landscape. Went on a weekday and found the traffic to be light (encountered 4 other groups). There had been sun the few days prior and the mud was not a problem - a couple of small, soft areas that were easy to walk around. Not buggy, maybe thanks to the light wind. ", "beautiful and fun hiking spot", "Really enjoyed this trail, looking forward to going back and giving the second loop a try. Something to be aware of- in the opening of the trail there are several small \u201cbridges\u201d and the wood is fairly rotten so watch your step! Muddy in spots but as someone else mentioned, nothing a good pair of hiking boots can\u2019t handle! Be prepared for a fair amount of uphill climbing :)", "First time and it was great. Would do it again for sure. A couple spots that could use markers but didn\u2019t take long to get back on track!!", "Very busy trail, we saw dozens of people, mostly in the first and last kilometre or two. The people thin out the further you get in. Very nice trails, well marked, well maintained and hard to lose yourself for the most part. It had some wet muddy spots, but nothing that a half decent pair of hiking boots won't just cruise through, no problem. We will be going back to do the second, longer loop soon. ", "As a new hiker going solo I tried the first and smallest loop of this trail. I quite enjoyed it and found it to be very busy, but that might have something to do with the virus being out. As for time I managed to finish it in under 2 hours, with some photo taking in there. Very fun trail overall and I'm interested in the other loops!", "Feb 23 - We only managed to get about a third of the way through before turning back because we were on a timeline. It's quite icy today with very slippery spots. I'd like to try it again when it's a bit warmer and the ice is no longer a danger. ", "the trail is still very icy but to be expected for February. went with my 2 daughters and we had fun. did not do the loop part of the trail because we didnt have enough time before the sun went down but we are definately coming back when we have more time so we can complete the whole trail.

Perfect for running, great views, clear trails and well-kept signage/maps.", "not very scenic and very busy with bikes and joggers, not ideal for dog walking lol", "Trail was easy to follow and well marked!", "really nice hike! Rocky and lots of roots which make it interesting. it was easy to follow an well marked. Some very beautiful views would be great for a picnic. Need good hiking or running shoes if you want to climb up on some of the boulders. In and out of the forest with some sunny spots along the way. Good for a morning or afternoon activity as it's not too long.", "Excellent trail. Well marked and relatively intuitive for the most part. Lots of inclines and descents throughout the loop with varying terrain. Beautiful views. Took about 2-2.5 hours for the pot lake loop at a brisk pace.", "A great hike for an autumn day. The leaves are turning and the scenery is beautiful.  \nThe tree roots and rocks in the trail can be a bit of a challenge. It can be hard on the knees. \nThe scenery is worth the hike!", "beautiful trail! Nice way to spend 2-3 hrs. we took a snack and had a picnic at one of the many nice openings where we could see the lake. ", "kids 7 and 5 were able to do it. lots of climbing around rocks which the kids loved, but can be hard on the knees. trail was fairly obvious, well beaten path and enough other hikers around to feel sure of where you are. ", "lots of roots and rocks on the trail. It was dry when I hiked but you can see a few spots where it is usually muddy.", "Great day for a hike. At the fork take the right it is more difficult but makes the return easier. Due to the weather this summer the trail is quite dry.", "Nicely maintained moderate use. Very rocky and roots tail surface. Well marked. No bugs when we hiked 11 to 2 pm aug 14", "This was a beautiful hike but was by far one of the more challenging ones I have completed, I would rate it closer to hard than moderate. The trail is moderate in that it is fairly easy to navigate and the slightly uneven ground to walk over branches and rocks most of the hike, however the length pushed it out of a moderate rating and into a hard for me, and there were points that could have used better marking too so you do have to be fairly comfortable with navigation. Despite it being a loop we somehow came out of the same place we went in which I assume is due to lacking markers towards the end of the trail, I ending up leading my self through the woods to the point I entered at rather than closing the loop.\r\n", "Loved this hike. Excellent variety in terrain with a nice challenge in elevation. ", "Great trail for running. Great elevation change and a variety of scenery. Bugs can be pretty dense so bring some bug spray!  Trail is easy to follow so don't worry about using your phone or GPS to guide you. Trail is marked and signs are at interesections detailing which way to go. Love this one.", "great trail with some mildly challenging rocks and hills. ", "I\u2019ve done this three times in the last six weeks. It\u2019s a great trail. Lots of big rocks and tree roots. For a well used trail I hardly encounter anyone on it. Was there after supper tonight and saw two people. ", "Great hike. Lots of climbing and easy to navigate trails. Some markers along the way but the foot paths are pretty easy to spot to keep you on track. Definitely bring bug spray!", "Very nice walk!!", "Great spot for all levels of hikers!", "Nice hike. Some steep sections to provide a workout. Lots of exposed tree roots as this is the first and most used loop. Not crazy busy this time of year.", "beautiful day on the trail today. did it in 1h40 and was walking with a fast pace. most scenic views are to the right on the first half of the trail. will definitely be back", "was a beautiful day for a hike. parking lot to parking lot took me one hour forty minutes. I walk fairly quick and don't stop often for pictures unless something catches my eye. most of the scenic part of the trail is on the right side when you get to the fork. will definitely be back again !\n", "Nice 2 hour and 15 minute hike but quite frequent encounters on this loop.", "ran the pot lake loop. very beautiful and the trails are extremely well marked. also very close to the city if you're looking to get away quickly \n", "This was only my second hike ever, parts were challenging, but overall great trail and view at the top. Can\u2019t wait to try the rest of the loops!", "Best done in May before bugs and people come out! Or in the Fall maybe.", "Beautiful trail and views. We picked a very hot and humid day to hike here and will choose a cooler day next time. Luckily, we had lots of water with us and we took our time! Highly recommend this trail.", "Really enjoyed this trail. Lots of great views. Well marked and easy to follow. Kids loved that there were lots of boulders to climb. Will be coming back to hike some of the other Bluff Trail loops.", "I run this trail 1-2 times a year. A great workout and pushes me to my limits. If you are trail-running, plan at least an hour+ for this run and bring lots of water. If you are hiking, plan at least 3+ hours. everywhere along the course you will find great views.", "Great hike. Really will do it again some day. I encourage everyone around to go and do it.", "Great hike very beautiful with lots of places to stop and enjoy the view. As often said lots of roots and some climbs but all in all doable.", "Great little trail.  Given my experience I would rate it as moderate. A lot of rocks and roots to walk through and a few good climbs.", "Beautiful! Great moderate hike.", "Hard", "Great terrain. Good sized loop for an afternoon hike.", "Great trail, great work-out!  Well marked and very clean.", "Good trail and not super well marked which is fun, kind of close to the highway so you can hear the cars pretty much into the loop. only downside though", "Beautiful trail! Definitely more challenging than expected. My only complaint is lack of trail marking can make it easy to get lost and end up on one of the longer loops!", "this was a surprise for me and my girlfriend who enjoy challenging trails. I recommend this hike", "Absolutely beautiful hiking trails, dog friendly on leash. Absolutely breathe taking views. Multiple trails within the one trail. Difficult at times but worth every minute.", "Of all the 4 loops of the Bluff Wilderness, the Pot Lake Loop provides the best cardio workout.

Official time in 08:08 and time out 20:17\u2026 was shooting for 10 hours but still feel great about finishing it in one day.  Trail was pretty visible.

Note that the full loop is 51km and not 44.9km.\n\nDay 1 (Red rocks - Seal Cove, 20km)\nThis is the longest day in kms, however the terrain is relatively flat for the most part. Not a very scenic day as most is spent in the woods. Camping at Seal Cove was great, we spent the night on the beach watching the sunset and my dog swimming. We had campsite #4 and it was good, the picnic table was nice to have.\n\nDay 2 (Seal Cove - Refugee Cove, 18km) \nThis is the most scenic day with lots of viewpoints. Very muddy though which definitely slows you down. The campsites at Refugee are really nice. We had #3 which also had a picnic table. It's a little walk getting to the beach though, which we were too tired to go so just stayed at the campsite.\n\nDay 3 (Refugee Cove - Red Rocks, 13km)\nNot as many kms but definitely more challenging with a big ascent right after leaving the campsite and then another big one going up an ATV trail. We also took the wooded trail at the end since we weren't sure about the tides, which gives you an extra 2km compared to taking the beach.\n\nMosquitos were REALLY bad when we went (Aug 22 - 24). Lots of water to filter and the trail is well marked. Overall great trail and could definitely see myself making it a yearly hike! :)", "Awesome hike, 9/10 difficulty, beautiful views the whole way along the coast. Lots of water to drink the entire time too", "Tough but stunning hike! We only did a portion of the park and climbed almost 2,000m in elevation. Loved it! So much so I am planning to do the 3 night/4 day total trail!! \nFinished with a 3k run along the shore in West Advocate!! ", "Stumbled on the trail ramdomly coming off of the beach. Cool views of the orange sand beach but over all hard trail. We didn't start at km 1 and had a hard time finding our way. There were no indications anywhere except for km's. So we had no idea how many km's all together. It was also quite a long hike before having an option to get out of the forest. Overall hard but I think would have appreciated it more if we knew what was coming and were more prepared. ", "An awesome hike forsure! We hiked counter clockwise, the trail was quite muddy between little bald rock and eatonville but the views make up for that! The two huge hills everyone talks about are wheeler trails so going up isn\u2019t to bad, it\u2019s just a long haul to the top. Tons of water to fill up which is great and the campsites are pretty good! Some have actual picnic tables others just have boards and stumps to make a makeshift table. Also no fires are supposed to be allowed on the backcountry campsites, so that was a bummer, but still an amazing hike, would recommend!", "Very well-marked trail, with some beautiful views, lots of wildlife, and terrain variation. As some other reviewers have mentioned, there were some very boggy spots partway through, but nothing that couldn't be handled. \n\nRegarding wildlife, we saw eagles, rabbits, deer, and frogs, and a number of jays. \n\nWe hiked the trail in 4 days, 3 nights. There is lots of beach access along many parts of the trail. \n\nHighly recommended for those interested in a multi-day hike. Remember that the tides in the area are dramatic and move quickly- keep an eye on your stuff if you have it on the beaches, and keep it above the tide line! ", "Tough trail for sure, but an amazing experience. Did the loop counter clockwise in 4 days, three nights \u2014 it was nice to get the wooded area done on the first day, and then have the coast for the rest of the time. Plus counting down the kms was so motivating for me!\nSome big hills up and down, and lots of muddy portions of the trail between Seal Cove and Refugee Cove. Saw lots of wildlife, and lots of friendly hikers and dogs.\nCan\u2019t wait to do it again!", "Did the trail in 2 days, 1 night. Hiked from Red Rocks to Keyhole Brook (26.8km) then to Eatonville to complete 36.5km (in lieu of returning along the 15km inland part). If we had booked earlier we would have stayed in Big Bald Rock instead only because it\u2019s a shorter distance, but no sites were available. Would recommend completing the trail clockwise since the hardest section is to Refugee Cove followed by the climb to get out of the cove. Occasionally felt blisters forming but with a little moleskin was able to stop them in their tracks. It would be a smart idea to bring hiking poles - about 50% of the people we saw didn\u2019t have poles and I was genuinely concerned for their safety. The trail is very steep and muddy in sections and the poles were everything in those moments. Plenty of streams with clear water so finding water was never an issue. Wore hikers on day 1 and trail runners on day 2 and it felt great to have dry shoes. Will definitely do this trail again, perhaps over three days or book earlier so we can travel less on day 1. Do your research before going!! ", "This is a hidden gem. The hiking was tough but the views were the pay off. There wasn\u2019t a section of the whole loop that I would have wanted to miss. Three of us did this trail in three nights and four days. Glad I trained a little! ", "Amazing but brutal trail. Hiked red rocks to little bald rock on day 1. Then to Eatonville on day 2 and finally back to red rocks on day 3. Lots of blister and sore legs by the end. Would definitely do it again just gave me a year to recover.", "Wet in spots and getting wide as folks avoid the mud. Need some volunteer trail crew to lay some logs and work on drainage.\nWell signed trail with great views of the bay of fundy (or sometimes just fog). \nGeologically interesting, lots of wildlife. \nOne of very few multi day hikes with campsites in all of NS.", "Definitely came as advertised!! ", "Completed the full coastal loop with my partner and 10 year old daughter this past week. Absolutely stunning views and by far the most challenging hike any of us have ever completed. We cried and we laughed, lots of great memories! ", "Wonderful long weekend trip. I\u2019ve done this trail both dry and wet, and in both directions. The trail is a bit rough in the rain but manageable. I would highly recommend!", "Did this 51km loop clockwise in two nights, three full days of hiking with a friend and our two dogs. We started at the visitor center and stayed at Refugee Cove on night 1 and Seal Cove for night 2. Highly recommend both sites as the camp sites are right next to beautiful beaches. Not all sites have beach access so these two are a must! Difficult pace for only two nights especially if you want some down time but very enjoyable of you're up to the task :)", "I ended up driving from New Brunswick Friday afternoon after work, and hiking into the dark. I had not planned my clothing well and was too cold to sleep in hammock so my dog and I ended up hiking the loop through the night. We were able to hear the ocean. But missed out on the views!! By daylight we were finishing up, signed out when lodge opened and slept in car for a few hours before driving home. Need to redo this. But it was a beautiful hike from the little bit we saw. It is longer then the site had said as well. We were happy to see the end when it finally came. ", "Amazing trail! But it is 51.4 km and NOT 44.9 as All Trails claims. First day is 12 km to Refugee Cove is a tough and technical section with 3 big climbs and descents - including one extremely steep descent - and ending in Refugee Cove. We spent our second night 14 km later at Keystone Brook which was a great site. We would have preferred to get to Seal Cove but because of a late start and ran out of daylight at 5pm and wanted to be able to see the stunning coastline. Day 3 was therefore 25 km back to the parking lot. It was a great stroll through the woods with a big ascent and decent towards the end. The trail was well marked. I wish they had names for all of the lookouts. Absolutely stunning coastline. ", "Trail Run - 50km Full Loop: \n\nStarted the route on the overland section to Eatonville. The trail was in good condition for running and I covered the first 18km in about 2.5 hours. The west coast section was quite a bit slower due to a combination of steep declines and inclines, lots of tricky tree roots, and skirting frequent wet sections but also beach visits, photo ops, snack breaks, view points, etc. It is absolutely beautiful on the west coast section. I was about 4.5 hours on this section. As soon as I turned the corner at the cape the trail running conditions improved and I was able to maintain a decent pace except for the steep climbs out of Refugee Cove and Mill Creek. \n\nTotal time for the full loop 9hrs 10min. \n\nWater: there were lots of places to get water along the route. I drank directly from streams the whole way. ", "Really great time! I did this around the middle of July and there wasn\u2019t one mosquito or black fly! \n\nRed rocks-Refugee Cove\nRefugee Cove-Seal Cove\nSeal Cove-Eatonville\n\nRefugee was my favourite place. Tide was out so I explored to the right of the beach and took in all of the wonderful cliffs and rocks. Stayed at site one at both camp sites and those were both good spots. Lots of places for water which is lovely. I\u2019d consider doing this in 3 nights, 4 days next time to thoroughly enjoy it. ", "Longest day for me, the part missing on my recording...forgot on pause!!   People say its the boring part of the loop, mostly in the wood.  But i really enjoy it, peaceful in the wood :)", "This is a great trail with amazing views!!  I definitely recommend this trail, and will do it again next year.  As the distances aren't too long between campsites and the hills aren't too bad, this trail is suited to new and seasoned backpackers.  There are plenty of water sources along the entire trail.\n\nDay 1: Visitor center to Refugee Cove - 3h45m.  Took a short break at mill brook.  This section of the trail was well maintained with a few hills.  There are a handful of points that allow you to see the coast.  Stayed in RC1.  Sites 1 and 2 looked nice.  I didn't see the other sites.  Just past site 2 on the right there is a little opening with a great tree for a PCT bear hang. A short walk from campsite to beach with cook kit, made for a nice supper.\n\nDay 2: Refugee Cove to Eatonville - 8h15m. the morning was foggy with no views, but it cleared up by lunch. This section was definitely the most scenic.  There are so many great spots for photos and take in the views.  Terrain was very rooty, but not much for hills.  A few short ups and downs.  Around km marker 25, got stung in the back of the head.  Didn't see or hear any nest until it was too late.  Lunch at Big Bald, and a couple breaks.  Arrived at Seal cove(original booking) at 3:30pm and wanted to push on.  Called and change my res to Eatonville.  Arrived at Eatonville at 5pm.  I had site 1 which is a great site.  Site 2 right beside is great also.  Both are right next to a good section of the brook.  Had difficulty finding a good tree for bear hang, but as I was the only one in the entire Eatonville campground, there was a great tree in site 2 to use.\n\nDay 3: Eatonville to visitor center - 3h15m. It was very misty and wet, so I was motivated to get off the trail before the rain (supposed to hit afternoon).  The first and last parts of this section have a couple hills, but the middle is very flat (along brooks), so you can make some good time.  Although this section has no coastal views, it is quite pretty in spots.  If this was a dry day, I imagine I would have found myself stopping to look at the scenery.", "The squirrels here really don\u2019t mess about!! Hang all of your food properly as soon as you get to camp, they won\u2019t hesitate to chew through anything your food is in. \n\nOther than that this trail is absolutely amazing!! We did 3 nights in total, doing it in reverse. \nParking - Seal Cove - 6.5 hrs\nSeal Cove - Big Bald Rock - 4.5hrs\nBig Bald Rock - Refugee Cove - 4.5 hrs\nRefugee Cove - Parking - 3 hr 15\n\nWe were really happy to get the 20k out of the way. Took lots of long breaks for views and really enjoyed the hikes on days 2 and 3. We were all warmed up to get the last day done quite quickly. All the campsites were really nice and the views here are just spectacular!! \n\nWould love to do this again, 4 days was perfect! Bringing poles next time though!\n\n", "Fantastic hike! The trail is well-marked and maintained, as are the facilities. They clean the \"pit privies\" every 2 days. This was my first solo multi-day hike, and it was a really great one for it. I will definitely do this one again!\n\nI hiked in a counter-clockwise direction staying at Seal Cove, Big Bald Rock, and finally Refugee Cove. I wanted to get the long 20 km day through mostly forests over with first, although that left the most difficult day for the end. One thing I really liked about doing it this way was that you hike through forests all day, and then finally getting to the coast and seeing those amazing views just makes it that much more breath-taking.\n\nBEWARE OF SQUIRRELS. When I got to Big Bald Rock campsite, I dropped my pack and went to check out the beach. I made sure everything was closed up so rodents/squirrels/etc didn't get in. When I got back, a squirrel had chewed a hole in my pack. That night, the squirrels chewed a hole in my sealine bag which I had HUNG UP to deter wildlife from getting my food. I am very grateful to the other campers who saved my food from being totally ravaged by the squirrels. Hang your food, hang it well, and don't leave any food or food bags unattended even for a moment.", "well maintained trail. did it in 3 days 2 nights. the campsite at little bald rock was nice and worth the extra kms. we got our campsite stolen at eatonville wich was a little annoying but luckily 2 other hiker shared a campsite and gave us one. overall excellent trail, lots of ups and down and lots of viewpoints. i highly recommend amd will do it again this year.", "Another year, another fun trip! That last part from Seal Cove to Eatonville is so tough\u2026 I always miss and get high Tide. I debate going counter clockwise next year, but then I\u2019ll miss the grand finale of the three sisters view\u2026 Though it would be cool doing the Eatonville day trails and getting more glimpses\u2026 The only camp I wouldn\u2019t recommend is probably keyhole Brook\u2026 Every other site has its own special piece of the puzzle\u2026 I love doing this in super hot conditions. I was so grateful it didn\u2019t rain\u2026 I did it in four days and three nights so I could really take it in\u2026 But in the future I might add another night on\u2026 Because I was in paradise being there.

", " this one was really hard on old girl hips. lots of roots and rock in the loop. walking along the beach section even in low tide was challenging.  sunny day and beautiful views, saw a really big bunny and two eagles. be careful close to the cliffs especially if you take a dog. ice was gone and mud was starting to thaw. thanks to the folks who maintain the trail with addition of logs and wooden bridges.\n\n", "Trail starts out on the beach so it\u2019s a bit rocky, definitely need good ankle support!

Lovely spot, with a seal hanging out in the beach on the way back to the parking lot.", "Trail was nice and packed down which made it easy to follow", "Great well marked trail but one spot at the halfway point had me searching for the yellow markers. Definitely want a good pair of hiking boots with ankle support as you are walking on beach rocks, shale and logs in various places. Lovely look off points in places. Definitely muddy and wet along many spots. The trail says 6.5km but my Fitbit tracker said 7.5km from the parking lot. On the return, took the trail on the hill next to the beach but owners ask you only do so when no horses in the field. Some people had their dogs but do caution that the shale along the ocean may be rough on their paws. Enjoy!", "Easy hike, trail is a little slick. I\u2019ve done it before In the summer and the trail can be muddy.", "Beautiful trail, proper hiking footwear is needed. high cliffs and beautiful ocean views; I recommend this trail pack a lunch and bring your camera.", "Definitely not an \"easy\" trail. Need good, solid hiking boots as you walk along pebbles at first and then later slippery rock. Well marked. Beautiful views!", "Beautiful hike! I\u2019ve done this one a few times, never gets old.", "Well kept trail with stunning scenery. As others have pointed out, there is a variety of terrain so wear proper footwear. Overall an easy hike and well worth doing. ", "Easy trekking, well marked with yellow paint markers & beautiful views. Loved the varied types of pathways along the trail: stone, split logs, corduroy logs..nice mix up. It was chilly starting out but was a great day to be hiking today!", "Great trail, beautiful scenery.", "Excellent! Well marked and gorgeous views. Third time back and still love it!", "If you haven't done this trail, well, you should... great trail with awesome views and moderate difficulty... Sunset is stunning if you can time your hike well.", "The trail itself was only challenging at the beginning- as in walking over the beach rocks. I used the private property hill on the way back because I found it so atrocious. \nThe trail is for the most part clearly marked with yellow indicators so you don\u2019t get lost. Whether it be on trees or rocks by the sea side just follow them. \nThe path is well maintained and an easy adventure walk. The scenery is absolutely stunning. The trail took me 7.5 KM and 2 hours as I dilly dallied a bit to take photos and footage on my camera. \nI didn\u2019t have any problems with ticks. \n", "Beautiful evening for the hike. 70 mins to complete.", "The rocks at the beginning were not too easy to negotiate but the rest of the trail was great!", "So, the first thing you need to know is that google maps sends you to the wrong place. No worries, the local residents have erected some signs to prevent you from going down the wrong road. Just keep going past the last road that google wants you to turn on and, instead, turn on Hirtle Beach Rd. There is a large parking lot there and it\u2019s fairly obvious you\u2019ve arrived.\n\nThe parking lot was packed but not full when we arrived in a Saturday at 11:00 AM. By the time we left at 1:30 PM, people were parking up and down the road\n\nThe only crappy part was walk the first/last part of walking across the rocks at the beginning/end along Hirtle beach. It\u2019s a rock painters dream, however. Do yourself a favour and take the uphill walk along the cliff to save yourself some walking on the rocks. It\u2019s private property but the owners only ask you to stay away if the horses are in the field. \n\nIt took about 25 minutes to get to the trail proper. It eventually is a loop. There is an earlier point that looks like it might be the loop but watch for the yellow markers. They lead you to the left. At the actual split, you can go either left or right. Left is a bit more challenging. \n\nTrail is easy to moderate. The kids and dogs can do it but not strollers. The Hirtle Beach portion is not for weak ankles or flip flops. \n\nTook is an hour and 5 minutes to reach Gaff Point in the middle. Nice inukshuks there and a few spots to stop for snack/break. Some really nice coastal views along the way. Trail is very mixed between wide forest path and walking along slate rocks. It is well marked with yellow paint. Trail conditions are great. ", "Great trail, pretty well marked and we found the secret beach. It starts on a beach and there\u2019s all kinds of terrain but ultimately it\u2019s a pretty easy, slightly moderate spot. Great views! ", "Amazing trail! Moderate difficulty. Worth the view!", "A must do. Great scenery of the ocean and interesting rock formations", "Terrain changed from sand to beach rock, to roots and granite rock.  West stable shoes.  Beautiful view.  There is a hidden beach but it was busy so not that secret and that was a cooler week day", "Very nice trail but very difficult to find due to incorrect directions on Google Maps. ", "Beauty!!", "beautiful trail with a great beach. bring your swimsuit for some water fun after this hike. the waves are bomb.", "A beautiful hike. Going at low tide is best so you can walk on the sandy beach. Otherwise you'll have to walk on the beach stones which is a bit awkward. There are some gorgeous views from the cliffs. ", "Love this coastal trail! Make sure to repel down to the sandy beach below. Spectacular views of the ocean and islands.  ", "2 days in a row! Spectacular hike", "Check my instagram for 12 min video. Awesome spot. Loved the walk and sights do not disappoint! Have proper footwear. No flipflops. @drscottmaclean #gaffpointtrail", "Great trail. It was a foggy day but still a great trail. Well maintained and easy to follow. Crossing a Stoney beach to start and end trail was the roughest ground. It was busy we met about 6 groups along the trail.", "Great and not to busy when I arrived at 10am. That changed when i returned to my car though.", "Beautiful trail. You have to walk on the beach for about 20 mins to get there which was nice as well. Few spots have downed trees on the trail but nothing too onerous to cross. ", "rocky along the water but fine once you hit the trail. honestly I've done a lot of hiking and this has been the best hike to date! Comparable to Taylor Head but I would say I enjoyed this more..  we even got to dip in the very cold and refreshing ocean afterward. highly recommend checking this one out!!!", "Loved this trail! A few trees down across the trail after storms this year. Not too hard to crawl around them though! ", "My definition of the perfect hike.  The trail is well marked and offers fantastic views throughout.  Loved the different terrain at various parts of the trail - from well-worn dirt paths, smooth rounded rocks, wooden planks, flat top stones, and more.  The trail is well maintained.", "Awesome trail. Hiked along the beach until we got to the trail head just to the right. Extremely well marked once you\u2019re on the trail. We kept to the left along the loop where we hiked through an area of sharp-ish rocks with a gorgeous ocean view. The point is a great place to stop and have a quick bite to eat. The way back was a bit wet with a couple of tree stumps to climb over but very well maintained. There were zero bugs but it was also only 14 degrees when we did the hike. Can\u2019t wait to go back!", "I love this trail. The only downfall at all is that the first and last is a very rocky 1 km each way that can be hard on the ankles but the rest is great and probably one of the best hikes on the south shore.", "Trail is pretty well kept. Absolutely gorgeous views but a lot of the time you\u2019re watching what your stepping on (on a lot of rocks). Very busy, thin trails. Great for a family walk.", "Has to be one of the best trials I\u2019ve explored so far. The trail was easily hiked and the views at every turn were breathtaking. Definitely recommend this trial. Will be back again.", "Great trail, beautiful sites", "One of my favourite hikes this year. We went a few days after Hurricane Dorian, so there were several downed trees across parts of the trail. That made some parts tricky, but still passable. The views are spectacular and worth climbing over some trees! We did it with our two dogs, they did find walking on the beach through the pebbles a bit difficult. ", "Wonderful views dry trail end of August, wear supportive comfortable shoes for the beach rocks and navigating tree roots, did the whole route in under 2 hrs taking time to stop for several photos along the point, if you choose to do only half the loop start on the left side for views if you don't mind some spots beach rock, someone painted yellow markers here n there for trail, can appreciate the logs in the marshy area that is needed during rains but personally didn't favour them on this dry day, the cliffs and mosses were beautiful and I would walk it again.", "Great hike, lot of nice views. The trail is well maintained, Recommend going out at low Tide.", "Trail was a great quick hike. From start to finish took me 1 hour 20 minutes with no stops in between. This trail is not strenuous but you definitely have to be sure footed on the beach rocks.", "Went on 03/08/2019. Started trail at noon, from Hirtle's Beach parking lot. The whole trail took us about 2 hours, with numerous stops and a swim at Hirtle's beach at the end. Walk down the beach for a couple kms to get to the actual trailhead. There's a few options to this: Walk on the sand, then up the rocks, or cut onto the farmer's private property and follow the foot trail up and back down the hill. We decided to walk along the beach. The rocks aren't that difficult, but witnessed some people struggling with their footing. An information board with a trail map indicates the started of the provincially maintained trail. You walk in abit and theres a three-pronged junction. Two of those have yellow spray paint indicating the trail to follow (That is used as the trail marker). This is the start of a loop. We took the right-most trail, hiking the trail clockwise. It is easy hiking through the forest, with numerous viewpoints of the ocean. The third path, the furthermost left trail, is an unmaintained foot path that'll lead you to the so-called \"secret beach\". This trail weaves along the cliff edge, and you may think that you're lost, but follow it to the end. Once arriving at the end, theres an overlook of the beach down below. Access it via the rope. Could be slippery if if was a wet day, so use your better judgement. Same can be said for swimming at that beach.  \r\nI would say the hike is a 3.5/5. Not that challenging, but on a nice day its a good afternoon hike. Not strenuous in the slightest. ", "I went at 8am on a Friday morning and there were 3 people at the beach and no one else on the trail. The volunteers do a great job of maintaining the trail though I felt a few yellow blazes could have been added. Gorgeous scenery though. Take tick spray and wear solid boots.", "What an awesome hike. This trail is worth every minute of driving to get to. Don\u2019t miss the unmarked trail to the hidden secret. ", "Was a trail with beautiful views by the cliffs and on the beach.  Watch out for ticks and make sure you bring bug repellant. Trail was a little muddy in some areas but there were logs put down to step on.  ", "Muddy sections need some upkeep but this is a favourite I have returned to for 14 years. I don\u2019t have a dog but if you do look out for sharp shale sections on coastline portion of the trail. ", "went with a group from the Hike NS Summit.  we started out in light rain which made the stretch across Hirtle Beach cobble a bit more tricky than the return when it was dry.  The spring rains and steady use of this trail made it quite muddy when you reach the wooded sections of the trail.  Having said that, my feet stayed dry and there were no big problems.  I believe this will be a great hike on a sunny day as the coastal sections are dramatic.  I did find the cobble a bit annoying and tricky to walk on.  Poles were handy getting around the mud puddles.  This trail is protected by the NS Nature Trust and the Nature Conservancy of Canada and the Kingsburg Trails Assoc?  ", "Did the hike today. the trail is very wet and muddy ( it rained for like a week) there is alot of roots, so watch your step. the views are still awesome \u2764", "love this trail!!! haven't found the secret beach yet, maybe next time.I am going back with in the next 2 weeks.", "great trail! I would rate it moderate for the uneven terrain  and some muddy bits ", "A great day with family.  We really enjoyed the trail as well as watching the giant waves coming to shore as we walked along the ocean.", "Definitely recommend this hike! It was suggested to us while we were visiting the area from Ontario in February. As many others said, the first stretch is along a very rocky beach but when you get to the trail it is well marked and well maintained. Beautiful views of the cliffs and water. We had some icy spots so I imagine other times of the year it could be quite muddy. We took about 2 hours from the parking lot and back with stops for pictures and views.", "Great trail with beautiful Oceanside views. The first km or so was crazy rocky, so be sure to have boots with good ankle support. Would definitely hike this trail again.", "A very rewarding hike with excellent ocean views. The first part of the trail crosses an eternity of lose beach rocks on the upper side of the beach. You should wear hiking shoes with ankle support - good place to roll an ankle. If you go in sneakers just be cautious. The trail itself is a loop with over half of it having ocean views. Good for on-leash dogs, however people like to break the rules which is rather annoying... parts of the wooded section of the trail can be extremely muddy but there are stones and boards to walk on to cross. There are also secrets to this trail. Find for yourself. \nThis is an area known for high levels of ticks so always practice good after-hike inspections of yourself and your pets. A good dose of the (pet-friendly) Atlantick spray before hiking this area would be recommended. Overall, this is a hike I go back and do every few years as it\u2019s interesting enough to do more than once.", "Great short hike with rewarding elevation changes, ocean views, a magical forest, and a few secret paths that you should explore. it is not EASY.. the trail requires rugged shoes, is very uneven in places, and the stones on the beach can be very hard to walk along, watch your step.", "Rocky beach, gorgeous cliff views, alternating terrain, inuksuks, mossy forests, a perfect day hike.", "Great hike, with amazing views for relatively little effort.  Cobble beach to start, check tides.  Follow loop clockwise for best impact.  Build an inuksuk, swim at a secluded beach.", "this trail begins at a lovely beach with good parking and bathrooms! the water is great for swimming and surfing! \n\nwalking close to the water on softer sand is very comfortable and pleasent! when the shore turns rocky, head to high ground where there is a beaten path. otherwise the round unstable rocks make for a difficult walk for sure!\nthe terrain has many changes which really make this hike fun and far from boring! great views, places to sit on ground to rest/lunch, explore off trail along shore, break shale to collect Fool's Gold, swimming holes. there is a place to jump about 30' down into a good pool! but it's also a good place to slip off the edge as you are running for the jump, and break your back on the rocks below! this is also a dangerous spot on the hike for kids who struggle with being aware of their surroundings!\nif you take your time to enjoy all this little gem has to offer, it is definitely an easy hike for all. any hike can be made difficult if you rush !! \n:)", "amazing views. the walk to the trail head along the beach on the Sea stones is not fun, but the elevated views from the point are gorgeous.", "Great trail. The first part along the beach is not the best way to start the trail, as it is quite long and not that beautiful... but lots of different paths and views are amazing ! Also not a lot of people so you get time to enjoy the trail on your own !", "Beautiful trail. Easily accessible for the whole family. The first portion (the beach) is not representative of all the nice things you can see along the way.", "Very nice trail with lots of different terrain and great views, it is quite annoying to get to the trail over the lose pebble beach but doesn\u2019t take too long.", "I did this trail 15 years ago with friends and everything I loved and hated about it then still applies.\n\nWear very supportive footware. This trail has many different types of terrain and having proper footware is a must.\n\nTry and arrive so that you can use the beach to walk on instead of the ankle rolling pebbles. Check the tide times.\n\nThe views are spectacular. The ocean puts on a show at every turn.\n\nJust make sure to leave lots of time, bring lots of water and proper food to sustain you and proper footware!", "Great day on the trail. Enjoyed with young kids and grandparents. Good for all. Beautiful view and a great place to picnic or enjoy a day at the beach at the end.", "Beautiful.", "One of my favorite!", "Lots of variety for a short hike,  should probably aim for around low tide for the beach bit.", "This hike starts out on the beach, then meets up with a very well maintained trail! It was foggy when I hiked it, but still a very nice hike.", "A Beautiful Coastal Trail with a mix of white sand beach, cobblestone shoreline, rocky cliff coastline, mossy meadows and evergreen forests.", "Beautiful spot, lots of beautiful look out points and not a difficult trail.", "Beautiful and well worth any trip. Park in the Hirtle Beach car park and run the coast along to Gaff Point. Worth any visit.

I would recommend doing Franey and Middlehead together as a nice hiking morning or afternoon.", "Magnificent views; easy hike.", "This has been my favourite trail so far; very easy for the kids but still some small inclines and declines throughout the well walked path. Some very close cliff drops throughout and the most amazing views.", "Easy hike for family. Very nice views, short walk! Well maintained", "I would call this one moderate.

Check Highland National Park, Parks  Canada  before you go. ", "Very pretty trail with some great coastal scenery. There are a number of scenic lookouts and areas to explore, with a couple of them were overgrown with downed trees. Can also get muddy in areas.

Ending view was lovely, very scenic, though can get quite windy and cool depending on the conditions that day, so dress accordingly. Good footwear recommended as there are lots of roots on the trail.

Some areas were a bit slick due to the weather but on a nice day proper footwear wouldn't really be a concern.", "Wonderful views, relatively easy hike. Loop back is great!", "Well maintained trail, pretty good views of the coast.  Drive through the hotel, parking lot is in the back.

Make sure to wear proper footwear even though the hike is pretty easy.", "Nice trail, fairly easy but a lot of people seem to think that means flip flops or high heels will be fine.  The trail is rock and root or dirt, very little in the way or boardwalks.  It does tend to be busy through the summer, it is a highly promoted trail in this part of the park.", "Amazing views, definitely worth the time to stop when touring the Cabot Trail.", "Stunning cliff top views and easy forest paths. Mostly solid terrain with a couple rockier rough patches, many small hills. Very windy!", "Agree with all the other reviews - great trail, spectacular views. My second favourite walk in the Cape Breton park!", "Great trail to the point which has spectacular views. Well worth a side trip - my second favourite walk in Cape Breton.", "An easy trail with great views. The trail can be quite busy as it is close to the park entrance. Even so, there are sections where you will still experience the \u201calone in the wilderness\u201d vibe. The trail is mostly flat with a few inclines and declines. I wore hiking boots but you could easily do it in sneakers or birkenstocks and you would be fine.", "Great trail. Relatively easy.", "Fun hike through forests and around the point which opens up to a great sea view.

Elevation gain is steady with some steep sections but beautiful payoff at the top. The sign says 4 to 5 hours at 45km per hour but it only took me 3 hours going at a moderate pace. After you get to the lookout point you can choose to do a small look that goes by Admiral Lake or you can just turn back the way you've come because the trail is really just an out and back with a loop attached and the view at Admiral Lake was not totally worth it.

Did it in the middle of the winter so it was quite icy. Lots of steep hills but was rewarded with great views. I did the admiral lake loop, and the skull rock lookoff.  Was about 11 km and took me and my golden retriever just over 2 hours to complete although we were moving quick and only stopped to look at the views.

I\u2019ve only ever walked flyers trail and salt marsh every other day so this was the first trail that I pictured as a \u201chiking trail\u201d. The sign says 4-5 hours but I hiked it in 90 mins. I\u2019ll definitely bring my wife and daughter out to experience this one. The trail seems well kept, marked with yellow indications every few meters and that makes it nearly impossible to step off the trail and get lost. ", "It\u2019s amazing trail.

We were lucky to have been able to ask a hiker who had just finished, and was able to explain what to do (the private property / no tresspassing signs make it hard to know what to do). We parked on the side of the road at the turn-around on Duncan\u2019s Cove rd, before the pylons blocking access to the residential area. From there, you just walk down Gannet Ln, hop over the car barricade, and turn right into the bush when you see the sign that says \u201ctrail\u201d.

The end views are incredible, but the hike in is horrendous. \n\nAs others have mentioned, Google maps marks the trailhead at Gannet Lane which is on private property. So the All Trails trailhead is where we started (which is also a challenge to find as there is no signage). I only had a \u201ctrail\u201d for about 1km in, the rest is marsh and bushes. I followed the All Trails map as there are 0 signs on the hike, and it was knee deep swamp for more than half of the hike today. Maybe I went off the actual trail somehow? If that\u2019s the case then the All Trails map is grossly wrong.

Beautiful scenery along the ocean", "This is probably one of the best coastal trails we have in NS, and that is saying something. The trail is not maintained but easy to follow. Once you get to the coast, you just follow along it until you reach the abandoned bunker. \n\nThe real challenge is finding the trail entrance. The app will take you to a trail head no one uses. Everyone goes in off Gannet Lane although it is a private road. \n\nYou go along Ketch Harbour Rd. to Chebucto Head Rd. And then turn on Duncan\u2019s Cove Road. If it is a nice day on the weekend, there will likely be line of cars parked along the side of the road. There is a house at the end with a \u201cprivate property\u201d sign up. Gannet Lane is a dirt road off to the right. There is another house at the end of that lane with a \u201cprivate property\u201d sign up. Here is where it is tricky to find the trail head. It is right by a power pole. I\u2019ve posted a picture. There are a couple little trails that all merge together eventually. \n\nThere is very little bushwhacking on the trail. You are out in the open for the vast majority of the hike, so sun screen and hats in the summer. You are right along the coast so it is windy. \n\nThe hike ends at an old army bunker. Well, there is a long rock wall about 5 - 10 minutes away that you can see from the bunker. There is a huge private home behind the rock wall. \n\nThis is definitely a moderate hike with lots of ups and down. We did see some dogs and children along the way. They can do it with some help. There are a number of spots that you are right by the cliff so keep a careful eye. \n\nTook us 1 hour and 22 minutes on the way in, stopping for pictures and enjoying the scenery. 1 hour and 4 minutes on the way out without many stops. It\u2019s about 6 kilometres. \n\n", "Such a beautiful area. The sea breeze, the sounds of the waves, just so nice. \n\nit's a pretty easy hike", "Love this trail. Have done many times to enjoy the view.", "Great hike! Not very strenuous and amazing views! WW2 bunkers were very neat!", "The trail itself is clear but prone to muddiness after bad weather. There are various routes you can take (either scrambling over rocks closer to the shore or heading through trodden paths in the trees and bushes). \n\nIf you start on Gannet Lane then there is quite a steep climb down at the start of the trail. The start of the trail is clearly marked by a wooden sign on a power line just before the private house. \n\nThe views are beautiful in all weather. Due to the up-and-down over the rocks, I would agree that this trail is moderate and you should come prepared with sturdy footwear and water. \n\nThis trail is not maintained.

It was kind of confusing to find at first.", "We parked at the turnaround near Duncan's Cove and Chebucto Head Roads and walked back to the trailhead on the oceanside marked by yellow nature preserve signs. Mid-March we ran into flooded sections every 5 min and only made it 2km in. On the way home we saw lots of cars parked at the lighthouse turnoff and Duncan's Cove Rd at Gannet Ln, mind the no parking signs, it would must be an easy walk from there to the oceanside. Will try that next time!", "Although it is hard to find and I did a different trail since I could not find the actual trail through all the private property signs I did find it by mistake. The easiest way to get to it is to park by the gate to the lighthouse and walk up the road to the lighthouse. On your right you will see one of the old Bunkers, follow the trail down to them and it continues around. I parked at a small turning spot where the Duncan's cove road and the Chebucto Head Heads intersect. There is a trail there that is about 2km of wooded/marsh trail and then becomes coastal taking you to the Lighthouse where you can continue to the Duncan's Cove trail and then just take the road back to your vehicle", "Great views, neat old buildings.  Many different ways to go as the trail is not marked so I went 2 different ways.  Awesome hike!", "Beautiful views of the coastal barrens. Found the trails further from the coast quite muddy. Need good shoes for navigating the rock near shore. I would definitely go back again.", "Beautiful! Took about 3 hours spent total, 2 there because we were exploring and enjoying the view and 1 hour back because we were hungry. \nBring water and snacks! Easy walking on the trail and easy enough to follow but better to stay in the main trail. Wear good shoes for hiking and bring layers since the wind can make it cold. Worth the trip!\nThe first bay is Duncan\u2019s cove and then there is duck reef and Eastern Cove which is the biggest, the end is Gill\u2019s Cove where you can see the lighthouse and get some shield from the wind behind the bunker.", "Beautiful views.  Can be very busy", "Amazing view, nice hike. The old forts are neat. Watch your step.", "Really beautiful hike along the water. Rocky terrain, just a couple of muddy spots. Saw a large group of seals on Duncan Reef. Trail is not marked, but quite easy to follow. Well populated hiking route. ", "ocean view hike, absolutely beautiful on a sunny day ", "Beautiful trail with amazing ocean views the entire hike. Got to pass 2 sea caves (could hear them only, not really see them) comparable to the Thunder Hole in Maine. No parts of the trail were muddy and was easy to find the way to the look out station as you could see it a few km ahead in the distance. This a trail we decided to leave our dog home for and I\u2019m glad we did. My opinion: this trail is not suitable for dogs - extremely sharp rocks/rough terrain, thorn bushes, and steep drop offs. An accident could easily occur, however people seem to think this is an off-leash free for all. Could be a bad situation if an on or off leash dog approached another as the trail is extremely narrow in places, often on the edge of a drop off.\n\nAside from that this is the most beautiful and enjoyable hike we\u2019ve done in NS to date. There was beautiful scenery at all times. My opinion: this is a much better and more diverse trail than Cape Split. The hike took us under 3 hours to complete (including two 10-min breaks, and a 25-min break for lunch at the end). \n\nNote: parts of the trail require a bit of maneuvering/slight rock climbing. ", "This trail is beautiful. Can be very tricky to follow as the trail is mainly human made but definitely my favourite in Nova Scotia!! \n", "Forced to turn back halfway through (before the reportedly spectacular ocean views) as the trail disappeared into a bog interspersed with pools. Prior to that there were multiple boggy/muddy sections that made for very slow going. Overall, a miserable aborted hike. If you care about preserving the environment do not attempt this trail for the foreseeable future.", "Depending on how you go about it (I\u2019ve done a couple different routes now) - parts can be a bit overgrown and you can lose track of the path when really wet (I most recently went in spring after a LOT of rain)... so also be prepared for your feet to get wet if you aren\u2019t wearing waterproof hikers. I wouldn\u2019t recommend doing this in sandals or flip flops. Great visits overlooking the Atlantic out at the mouth of the harbour.", "All swamp and bogey ", "*THIS IS A NATURE RESERVE - NOT A PARK*\r\nThe trail is NOT managed.

Overall, a great active hike along a gorgeous coast line.", "I enjoyed this trail, was absolutely beautiful. A little tricky is places due to rough terrain and mud but that\u2019s a part of hiking and part of the adventure. I\u2019ve never done this hike before so I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s always quite wet or if it\u2019s just because it\u2019s spring and wet anyway but I\u2019d recommend extra socks and shoes for after. Also, if you\u2019re someone you needs to use washroom regularly it\u2019s not a great spot. No outhouses (which is noted) but also no trees to hind behind. Lol", "I did the trail on a foggy day.

Well worth it.", "A gorgeous hike right on the ocean - highly recommended!", "Very busy trail and easy to walk past the trailhead. Aside from that this is an easy trail for anyone to walk and the views are absolutely amazing. We saw seals wading in the surf the day we were there.

Beautiful views all the way, gorgeous fauna and lots of places to stop and let the dogs have some water. Loved the variation of trail from open flat rocks to short steep stints to deep forest and windy trails through lush plant life. Our dogs had no problem with this hike, just took it slow to allow for breaks and water. 3 hrs round trip with our breaks.", "Great views along the entire trail. Some boggy areas, but managed not to ruin my boots. Some steep climbs and ascents. Be sure to wear appropriate footwear. Entrance to trail can be confusing.

Trail is quite muddy in parts!", "Very scenic.", "Really enjoyed this trail. Not overly challenging and beautiful views of Nova Scotia\u2019s rugged coastline. Will definitely be back to do this hike over, and over again.", "Amazing trail, with a wide verity of scenery it has something for everybody, and depending on how brave you are, many small rock beaches to explore", "Beautiful hike with stunning views!!! Terrain can be a bit muddy/soggy so make sure to have good footwear!", "Absolutely beautiful hike.  You will see waves crashing on the shore, rolling hills, woods, cliffs and even bunkers that were built for WWII.  The scenery is breath-taking.

Ash Lake is quiet and lovely. It's really good to record and compare with the map as the trails can be a little faint at times. There are tapes and paint at tricky spots though plus some signs.

I would certainly do it again :)", "Once you leave the Hobson's Lake Trail, you are more likely to see a canoe or kayak then another hiker.  As a result, the Ash Lake loop offers a great opportunity to empty your mind and just enjoy the day.", "Great backwoods wilderness trail that is relatively close(10-15min) outside of downtown Halifax.  The Ash Lake part of the hike is not as well trodden but is still fairly well marked with ribbons on the trees. Took me about 2:20 to complete.

Prospect, Nova Scotia. Coastal trail along the shoreline. View of ocean, boats and seabirds. Rocky and dirt paths, some mud, some overgrowth (waist high bushes but path still visible). Mostly low level vegetation, very open, no shade. Busy during sunset near start of trail.

Also very overgrown and bushy trail - would recommend pants and hiking boots. ", "Enjoyed a hot sunny day hiking this trail with friends (in our 50s 60s) for about 2 hours.  The views are spectacular and the hike fairly easy for all levels of ability.  There are a few boggy spots but some kind people have placed boards across for easier access.  There are beautiful flowers and what looks to be blue berries and maybe cranberries.   The following is a warning of another hiker with her huge black dog.   The dog was coming towards us and we asked her to call it back.  She didn't.  We asked again.  \"please call your dog we're afraid of it\".  She got closer and the dog was around us.  I asked could you please get your dog can't you see someone here is terrified.  She then went off saying \"the dog's FINE\" and now she's angry at us \"IT'S AN OFF LEASH PARK\".  I said listen we've asked you politely can't you just get your dog?  Then she said \"it's got a muzzle\"  and she walked off.  The dog didn't do anything to us I need to make that clear.  But as a dog owner when someone is terrified of dogs they don't know and you ask polity for them to call their dog back could you just be kind and considerate... I know most are.  So be warned of the older woman \"Karen\" (not the dog) ", "Great trail!

Bring pants for high grass.", "Very easy to find, and pictures can't compare to seeing this place in person. It's a little muddy for the first part of the trail if you park at the cul-de-sac (depending on time of year). The views are beautiful and you can see the seals laying on a rock island. ", "My daughter and I walked this trail this afternoon with our Labrador retriever.  It is a gem. \n\nIt is rough and wet in spots   However we have had a very wet spring so far this year.\n\nIt was arguably the nicest day we have had in 2019 thus far and today is a Sunday.  Hardly anyone was there!  \n\nThe three of us enjoyed the moderately difficult hike, the lack of flies, the low number of people and the gorgeous views. ", "A lovely little hike to beautiful Prospect.  But beware if it has rained recently, it is very very boggy on the trail so wear appropriate footwear. Rocky underfoot as well. Alternatively, tide permitting you could walk over the rocks which woukd make easier going if boggy. I parked at Hages Lane turning circle walked to Prospect 4.4km and looped back 4.7km along the road as i was pushed for time and tramping back across the bogs is time consuming watching where you put your feet. It is windy on this coastline when the mist is in so wrap up in layers. Also spotted some birds and ducks along the way. ", "Beautiful coastal hike. Winds off the ocean keep things cool so dress accordingly. We did not encounter any other hikers this time of year. The exposed trail was wind swept with snow built up in crevices (sometimes knee deep). Exceptional scenery. Be prepared and bring water and food. There was some water we had to navigate as streams were flowing from melt water and rain. We hiked from Prospect Village along the coastal trail and looped back on the road to our truck. Total distance covered was 8.8km.", "I lived in Prospect Village for years and just love the area. It's just beautiful in all seasons. Hiking is especially pleasant in summer. The trail is often cool due to wind off the water and fog. Layers are highly recommended,as well as sunblock and a good tied on hat...wind and sun can be strong. Getting close to the water can be dangerous. Be wary of waves and dark, slippy rocks. The tide can come in quickly. Beautiful spot to visit.", "Great views. Suggest to take two vehicles and park at each end so you don\u2019t have to double back.", "Absolutely gorgeous views but you need to watch your feet as the trail can be rocky or soft. Very easy to twist an ankle. And yes sometimes it can be tricky to find the path. This is NOT private land. It\u2019s a conservation area and the trail is maintained. Wonderful rocky points to climb and sit. Saw people fishing off them. Beautiful spots to watch the sunset.  No services and there\u2019s no easy way to return to your car.  So plan to hike back. I went three times during my week in the area. A hidden gem b", "Great trail for hikers of all levels. The end of the trail is a beautiful lookout and is spectacular to see, especially for somewhere so close to the city. Make sure to keep to the left when you start out on the trail as it can be easy to get off the main trail veering ever so slightly right and you\u2019ll get into some thick brush.", "Great hike, beautiful views.

Park at the top of the parking lot away from the info centre and walk straight past the campground for a few minutes. \nThis is a very strenuous hike. I recommend counter clockwise. The first 20 minutes is an unrelenting steep incline, but the other way is even harder. You do get nice views of the mountain range on your right. Once you get up that initial kilometre or so, it\u2019s more sane with a mix of up & down with a lovely, babbling brook beside you. Then the last kilometre or so is up, up and up to the top.

You come around the turn and start heading along the other side of the trail but it is still a little way before you get to the red Adirondack chair.

The coastal side was pretty clear, not much snow. The interior side along the Brook was quite snowy in parts. Really beautiful views, good incline. Was very windy that day, we did the coastal side first so the wind was at our backs and it was lovely. Lots of downed trees on the coastal side, and LOTS of moose poop, and tracks. Both really fresh.

I have hiked this trail two other times, both times completing it counter-clockwise, and now that I\u2019ve done it clockwise, I can\u2019t imagine why we ever did it the other way! \nThe way up, there are a few steepish hills, but nothing too challenging for someone with average to good cardio fitness (hills aren\u2019t my forte!). Also on the way up, you will encounter SO much moose scat and a few spots of bear scat. I actually did this hike alone this time, and I admit, I was a little nervous. There are many berry patches and open bushy areas on the ascent, that I imagine would be pure heaven for bears. But I didn\u2019t see any think more animated than a squirrel with a leaf in his mouth, peering at me in fascination, from behind a tree trunk. It could be I was the only person he saw, as there was NO ONE else on the trail with me the entire time. It was eerily quiet- other than my loud singing and yogi bear calls, to ward off furry company.\nThe view was uninspiring, ONLY because it was foggy - not the trail\u2019s fault - my bad for picking a foggy day. Other times that I have done this trail, the views are out of this world - so I do recommend going on a cool, clear day, if you are looking for the best vistas. \nThe entire way down, you will feel as if you are stepping through a rain forest but without the humidity, and the stream at your side is so zen-like. Something out of a movie, truly. It looks so different than the trail on the way up - much greener and more lush - like completely different trails that have been merged. A few bridge planks are a bit slippery, so watch your footing, and there\u2019s only one muddy area to traverse. So very easy in that sense.\nGreat hike, overall! But I highly recommend having a hiking buddy for this one, just for safety sake. Also cell phone service is there almost all the time, but there are a few quick spots where you\u2019ll have no service. Walk a few steps and it will return.

Pick which order you think you\u2019d like to see it in, or you can do an out and back of the west side if all you want is views. I went with the woods first (counterclockwise) and it seemed like the way up the hill may have been a bit less steep that way, although either way is a gradual climb and isn\u2019t anything super strenuous, and either way the views are worth it.", "Challenging incline and superb views. We saw 2 moose at the very top - very very worth it. On the way down we followed the river back to the carpark. One of our favourite hikes in Cape Breton.

If u do the loop, be mindful the conditions of the interior trail is rocky and many sections also muddy because it runs along a brook. U will see a number of small waterfalls.

I will be trying this one again in the future!", "Great loop trail with fantastic atlantic coastal scenery. Trail can become a bit absent in a couple parts, one notably by the large salt water pond near the tip, in which you'll pick up the trail again on the other side by either traversing the rocks on the ocean side or thru the tall grass on the other side of the pond, which could be a bit wet depending on the season. Also if you're doing the trail CCW, the trailhead is not marked with anything but a couple rocks just before it so this is where a previous gps track might help."], "key_words": [["Hiking"],

Easy to spot where but once you get to the top of Labrador Lake, it\u2019s right there. \nThere are 3 trails, but the blue trail is just a shoot off the red trail. Red trail is a much slower, easier hike on an old logging trail. Some short steep parts. Its 1.5 Kms. The yellow trail is much steeper and more like traditional hiking, although it\u2019s only 1.2 kms. We took the red trail up and yellow down. \nThe trails are well marked. The marked red trail is off kilter with the app and you\u2019ll get a off trail warning for the last 3rd. But follow the marked trail and not the app. You have to look around for the yellow trail head when you\u2019re on top of the mountain, but it is down to the left. \nThe views on a clear day are spectacular. You can see all the way to Smeltzer Brook Bay near where you start. \nTrail head is in a small parking lot. Easy to start in the wrong direction. Go toward the road. ", "Nice look off.

We had the summit to ourselves and only came across three other groups.", "Make sure to take the yellow route one way, so worth it! ", "definitely a fun trail. suitable for beginners and more advanced hikers. just choose the final trail up to the Rock wisely. If you're going to take the yellow trail you're going to need good shoes and have some technical hiking ability, but the red or blue you should be able to walk up and just regular sneakers without any trouble. the 3 km into the actual ascents to the Rock are very easy gravel top and well-maintained. the views from the top or stunning and definitely worth it.", "We parked near the highway at the start of the Chester connector trail. It is a well maintained gravel (stones) road. It\u2019s not really my preference for hiking, but the scenery on both sides is pretty nice. Great views of the rivers and ponds. Once you reach the Castle Rock trail you can continue on a similar road (red route) or take the yellow route which is mainly in the woods. It is the best part of the hike in my opinion. It\u2019s a lot of uphill, but worth it. The view from the top is pretty impressive.\nWe continued the hike by following the red route back out to the Chester connector trail. Again it is a loose stone road which is great for 4 wheelers and bikes but kinda boring for a hike. \nAll in all, it\u2019s a good hike. There is pretty scenery, and a great view from the top. I\u2019ve done it a couple of times, and would do it again, but I probably won\u2019t do the red route again. \nI think a thank you is in order to the folks who maintain this trail, it is obvious that they work hard to keep this multi use trail in such great shape and so accessible. \nOh... don\u2019t forget to bring bug spray.

Once you make it to the loop it\u2019s much rougher. You have three options to hike in; easy, moderate or hard. We took the hard route and I\u2019m glad I had my hiking boots for that section. Absolutely stunning views at the top! Will definitely do it again.", "Amazing scenery along the trail and from the top!", "Beautiful Trail...I\u2019d recommend ice cleats now at the end of March. Making the steep hill climb easier on ice. So much beauty for you to see.", "Beautiful streams and a lake along the way, then a stunning finish.", "Very nice view at the end. Worth the hike!", "Fun hike with breathtaking views once you reach the top of the rock.", "Beautiful view.", "Great trail. Though there is a long portion along the old railway (Rum Runner trail) to get to the base of Castle Rock Mtn it follows along a picturesque creek, ponds and Labrador Lake. If you cycle the rail trail part there is a bike stand to lock up your bikes before doing the Castle Rock climb.\n\nNote the parking location is not signed on Hwy 329 and access to it is right where the trail crosses 329 and looks like you will drive down the trail on the east side. But if you use this map it will help you locate it.", "great trail with an amazing view at the end.", "Nice easy hike but I only gave it 3 stars because 6k of 9k are on the rails to trails. Nice view of Mahone Bay when you get to the top of Castle Rock.", "Castle Rock Trails are accessed from the Chester Connection Trail.  There are currently three trails with varying degrees of difficulty and appropriate uses. Wayfinding posts are now in place and a trailhead kiosk is coming soon.

Your feedback is always welcome.  Enjoy everyone.  It's a lovely hike.", "Gorgeous trail! Excellent for beginners, no mud at all, nice and flat. Definitely one of my favourites! ", "The view from Castle Rock makes it all worthwhile. I did not enjoy the long walk along the Road. In the future I would walk in and out along the old rail line.", "Very easy hike - basically just walked back the tracks several kilometres (away from the ocean - closest to exit 7 but on highway 3. After a few kilometres along the flat tracks you see a little road to the right with a castle symbol on a small sign. As you go along, look for the yellow, red, or blue castle signs. Follow whichever one suits your difficulty level. None of them are overly difficult - I might recommend not taking your dog up the hardest/steepest trail and you have to walk up or down some rock face. Parts of the trails very very muddy - mud holes you had to try to get around. You scramble up the final section of castle rock. There's a Canadian flag at the top and the view of the Atlantic Ocean is beautiful. You can see for miles in all directions due to how high you are.

Seeing groups of 100+ travelling together to this secluded area, which is on private property, disheartens me greatly. \n\nHype will be the death of many amazing things, unfortunately. \n\nThe vast amount of trash left behind by hikers and campers is very disrespectful to the land, the animals the owners and to others who pack out everything they pack in, as all good hikers/campers know to be a written rule of the outdoors. I, and others for sure, am/are sick of seeing tissue and drink containers strewn throughout trees, grass, shrubs, the beach, the river and anywhere else. This goes for tents and camping gear as well. If your items fails you while there, take it with you rather than being lazy and leaving it behind. If you must use th washroom, dig a cat-hole and burry your waste. Have a garbage bag for tissues. Tie and take it with you when you leave. Many people assume tissue to be biodegradable but it does not dissolve in hours. It will hang around for long enough that it will be in the way of others. The animals should not have the chance to eat this and people should not have to avoid areas where hundreds of people have thrown used tissue. \n\nThe scenery is amazing and the hike is great but the disrespect is unbelievable. PLEASE pllleassse be a respectful visitor before this land becomes inaccessible to everyone. ", "Believe the hype. This place is absolutely breathtaking and worth every second of pain to get there. We are moderately experienced and average fitness, and this was a real challenge. It took 2.5 hours in, and 3 hours out. The terrain/elevation graph on here is well worth examining so you can get a sense of what lies ahead; there are many stretches that are unrelentingly steep with loose and uneven footing so knowing just how much longer you have to go on any particular stretch was a sanity-saver for me. Be aware that the trail is also one-person wide pretty much all the way, with steep hillside on one side. Tread carefully! On the outward journey, halfway in you descend into a river valley and this is a good place to rest, and refill water if you have filtration.  Things to take: hiking poles (or a good stick) are essential - trust me, you will need them. And take more water than you ever think you\u2019ll need; my three-litre camel pack ran dry with about 40 mins return to go. And food, whether a packed lunch or a bunch of energy snacks, is a good idea. \n\nAs for the Cove itself - absolutely STUNNING. Meadowlands, hillside, beach, forest, rocky headlands, with a river estuary splitting the beach in two. We spent 2 hours here and easily could\u2019ve spent six more. Next time, we will definitely pack (lightly!) for an overnight. It would be magical!\n\nThe horses were the highlight. Friendly and inquisitive, we spent some time saying hi. A little later when we settled in for lunch the whole herd came running over in the hopes of food - not aggressive, at all, but a group of 1000 KG+ curious horses can be pretty intimidating! We had to move aside and watch as they trampled our stuff and ate what they could; at one point, I had to wrestle my day-pack from one of them who had it in its mouth! Fun, but be ready for them. \n\nThe return is a killer, no bones about it. The descents on the outward route become the ascents of your return, and they can be brutal. By far the hardest part is the final return peak; that river valley I mentioned earlier? Yeah, you gotta climb out of that on your way back. It\u2019s the last 90 minutes and after that climb the trail undulates steeply until the final descent to the trailhead. I imagine most people will be pushed hard by this part; us included!\n\nPack well, allow plenty of time if you think you need to take it slowly/take multiple rest breaks, and you will be rewarded with one of the best hikes in Cape Breton", "awsome \n", "Hiked this trail today - loved it! Challenging, the views are spectacular, no concerns with losing the trail. The horses were not here for us to see but that didn't spoil the hike at all. Walking poles are a must. Didn't camp overnight; hiking in and out was very doable.", "Just completed this trail last week.  Absolutely loved it for numerous reasons. Challenge, beauty, length all 5 stars.  It could be cleaned up a little but the destination is most certainly worth everything this trail throws at you.  BRING WALKING POLLS or find a good stick BEFORE you leave.

I can\u2019t wait to go back again and stay two nights instead of one.  The hike can be tricky at times with very steep drops. Having a walking stick really helped with the inclines and declines.

Some areas overgrown, but only in a few spots. The majority of the hike is through wooded areas and relatively clear trails. The views and beach at the end were spectacular. Horses make it a pretty unique spot!", "Definitely will be staying multiple nights next time. By far the most challenging and rewarding hike I've done yet. Steep climbs and beautiful views. Seals and horses in the cove. A lot busier than expected, we stayed on a Monday night and there were four other groups.

", "A fantastic hike along the edge of land where the Cape Breton Highlands meets the Gulf of St Lawerence. Beautiful scenery and a very tough hike. Lots of vertical hiking keeps your heart rate high for sure. Beware of cow parsnip as it can give you severe burns. Wear long pants as there are raspberry and other bushes to hike through. There is a small river crossing at the halfway point. Easy to cross during the dry season, but a springtime crossing would be interesting. At the end when clear of the bush and walk out onto the elevated meadow heading down to the cove, a breath taking view. The beach, the meadow, the river and the horses!

During the day Saturday we went on a day hike, and returned to find that my new MEC tent had been completely trampled by the herd of wild horses. Poles were snapped, my fly was shredded, and the screening was ripped in several spots. DO NOT LEAVE YOUR TENT UNATTENDED. I wish someone had told me before hand. There was no food in the tent, it was stored elsewhere in a bear barrel. The horses are very de-sensitized and will bite out pieces of your tent so be prepared to set it up in one of the wooden enclosures and not leave it for long periods of time.

I will defiantly will be returning for the fall colors of 2020.  polletts cove", "What I love about this hike is you can make it a camping excursion or hike to the river for a half day hike. Both are amazing and I would say fairly challenging. It was hot today; 32C so the incline near start was very noticeable! Walking sticks are good to take, good hiking boots and I didn\u2019t but should have worn pants! I miss the cows. They had the trail well eaten and beaten and now it\u2019s a bit thorny and alders are growing up. There\u2019s a couple of easy streams to cross before the river valley. It\u2019s not quite as \u201copen\u201d as I recalled but still stunning views; you see the Bay St Lawrence the whole hike; even in the trees.  Lots of birds - warblers galore, and gannets. And we saw whales. Paradise. ", "The most incredible hike I\u2019ve ever been on! The hike is challenging at times - however the view takes your breath away more than the hike. There is a river to cross, and right now there is a small muddy patch to walk through (not sure if that\u2019s always there), as well as some fallen down trees you have to go around near the end.

A great NS trail. ", "My wife, my son and I are Adirondack 46ers and have hiked a lot over the years. This was one of the best and most beautiful we have done. It helps that today's weather was perfect - low 20s (Celsius), clear sky and modest humidity  - but it is more than that.  We were able to get to Pollett's Cove in 2.5 hours and it took the same time to return. We had been warned that this is an over-nighter, and it would be great to camp and explore the environs. That said, it is a wonderful and very realistic day hike for those with a bit of experience and hike with some speed. There are plenty of things to see - mountain meadows, deep gorges cut by streams and spectacular ocean vistas.  The trees, flowers and grasses are wonderful and conspire to create dramatic views to surprise at almost every turn. Then there is the wildlife. We did not see the mythic wild horses - maybe next time. We did see an abundance of pilot whales and bald eagles.  At one cove, far below us, we saw a coyote fighting with 4 bald eagles and a number of ravens over the carcass of a recently beached pilot whale. This hike has a grandeur about it and a remarkable feeling of remoteness combined with an excellent footpath. With all this said, anyone trying this hike should be prepared to work hard, exercise appropriate safety, be respectful of the environment and be properly equipped. There are very steep parts that can get slick, as well as steep drops. Beginners and many intermediate hikers will find much more accessible and appropriate trails in the Cape Breton National Park.

I have hiked this trail many times and will continue to revisit! Besides what has already been written about the trail's condition, I would add. . . . I have noticed that over the last couple of years Hogweed has started to grow along the side of the trail in a few different locations. Hogweed can cause painful blistering to the skin if one comes in contact with the sap. So (as always) be mindful while trekking along the trail. Also over the years I have noticed various amounts of garbage and trash being left around the Cove. Just a friendly reminder to everyone to do their part to clean up after themselves (leave no trace) and maybe even take it a step further and clean up other waste that you find.

View and horses were the reward. 3 hours in and 2.5 out on the same day. Best hike in Cape Breton so far. ", "We loved this trail but had quite an adventure. We would definitely rate this as one of our top five hikes! It\u2019s not that difficult from an ascent standpoint as I expected but there are several challenges along the way; a very muddy bog section, a wide brook to cross as well as several other minor to a little larger water crossings (and remember that you\u2019ll have to repeat all of this on your way back) and very narrow and overgrown shrubs- some were face height but I\u2019m just 5\u20193\u201d. What I did not expect was the most beautiful view after coming down the first mountain- totally jaw dropping beautiful; a combination of \u201cthe hills are alive with the sound of music\u201d with ocean views. The horses were further back towards the river so we did not see much of them but the views made this hike totally worthwhile for us. I also don\u2019t think that there is a need to spend the night in order to accomplish this hike. For a reference point, my husband and I are both 62 but have done several more difficult hikes in the past. ", "Awesome hike! We did an east coast trip this summer and hiked lots of trails and this one was definitely one of our favourites. It can get a bit slippery and steep at times but the views and good vibes are worth it! The campsites looked like people haven't been cleaning up after themselves very well. (Please tidy up after yourselves as it would be a shame to degrade and/or loose access to this special place!). We hiked in and out in an afternoon but there are places to camp - we'll definitely stay over next time!", "This hike was a rollercoaster ride (literally). Plenty of very long climbs and long drops. There is a beautiful brook midway to have a nice break at but coming back and climbing that midway hill was a challenge. This hike was like walking into a storybook world. The cove is absolutely\nBreathtaking. But so is the hike itself. A challenging one but most definitely worth it. One word of advice, the horses are VERY curious so be careful. We set up our tent and went down to walk the beach quickly and came back to 9 horses eating all our food and beating down our tent. Had to make- shift back together but even through all of that this hike is 100% worth it! And left us with great stories to tell. Would recommend for sure, just make sure you are ready for a challenge in climbs and some very friendly horses. ", "Other than a few light stream crossings and some exposed drops, this is a fairly moderate trail. The wild horses are gorgeous and extremely well accustomed to people.

See also my \"Hike In\" for the trek to Polletts Cove..............\n\nOn Thursday and Friday we hiked Pollett\u2019s Cove, which is in NW Cape Breton in the Aspy Fault Wilderness. The only access to the cove is via boat or the narrow trail we travelled on. It is owned by a local lottery winner who generously makes it available for public use. The hike starts near Gampo Abbey, a Buddist monastery in Pleasant Bay. The trail mostly follows the coast line and is 8km in each direstion. It starts with a very nasty climb until you reach a stretch that is briefly flat along a cliff edge. It is followed by 3 knolls and then a steep decline into the cove valley. The trail is narrow throughout, and often traverses near vertical slopes and cliffs, often rough with loose rocks. The weather was hot and muggy. I would not want to travel these sections in wet weather as it would be very treacherous. The latter part of the hike had a couple of stretches through deep wild roses and other 6 ft tall vegetation. As we were staying overnight, we carried heavy packs with our necessary gear. In total the track had 2800 ft of elevation change. Easily the most difficult we have completed so far. The cove was outstanding consisting of a valley with a mountain stream draining to the ocean and populated by at least 11 wild horses who are very tame and curious about campsites. The night we were there there were about 12 fellow hikers staying overnight, all half our age. It was fun watching the horses visiting the campsites in hopes of food rewards. Among the horses was a foal who was still nursing. While in our tent reading, some visited us as well. A beautiful place truly in the wilderness. This was our first overnight tenting hike and we had a sleepless night which made the trek out exhausting. We were awakened by coy-wolves howling on the nearby hillside. On the trail, some of our fellow hikers came across a bear cub.\nWe will visit here again though we will be more economical with our packs which were too heavy.", "Aug 2nd hike on a warm humid day. This recording is the hike to the cove as we stayed overnight. The early portion of the hike was a long and steep climb on a narrow trail. Most of the remainder was up and down good sized knolls also on a narrow trail. Overall a difficult track but very worth while once the cove was reached. We swam in the stream that drains into the ocean and camped in the valley. Currently 10 wild horses live in the valley and we found them very tame."], "key_words": [["Hiking", "Over grown"], ["Backpacking"], ["Backpacking"], ["Hiking"], ["Backpacking", "Muddy", "Over grown"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking", "Great!"], ["Hiking", "Great!", "Over grown", "Rocky"], ["Hiking", "Great!", "Over grown", "Rocky"], ["Hiking", "Great!"], ["Backpacking", "Muddy"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking", "Great!"], ["Hiking"], ["Camping"], ["Hiking", "Great!", "Rocky"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Fishing"], ["Hiking", "Great!"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking", "Great!"], ["Hiking", "Great!", "Rocky"], ["Hiking", "Great!"], ["Hiking", "Over grown", "Private property", "Rocky"], ["Backpacking"], ["Backpacking", "Great!"], ["Camping", "Great!"], ["Camping", "Great!"], ["Backpacking", "Private property"], ["Backpacking", "Over grown", "Rocky", "Scramble"], ["Hiking", "Great!"], ["Hiking", "Great!", "Over grown", "Rocky"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Nature trips", "Over grown", "Rocky"], ["Hiking", "Great!", "Over grown"], ["Backpacking"], ["Hiking", "Blowdown", "Muddy"], ["Blowdown", "Over grown"], ["Hiking", "Great!", "Rocky", "Scramble"], ["Hiking", "Blowdown", "Over grown", "Private property", "Rocky"], ["Hiking", "Muddy", "Over grown", "Private property", "Rocky"], ["Hiking", "Over grown", "Private property"], ["Hiking", "Over grown"], ["Hiking", "Blowdown", "Muddy", "Over grown"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Cross-country skiing", "Rocky"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking", "Over grown"], ["Hiking"], ["Backpacking", "Over grown", "Private property", "Rocky"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking", "Muddy", "Over grown"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Over grown", "Rocky"], ["Backpacking", "Rocky"], ["Backpacking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Backpacking"], ["Hiking"], ["Backpacking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Backpacking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Camping"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Backpacking"], ["Hiking"], ["Backpacking", "Great!"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking", "Great!"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Camping"], ["Hiking"]], "ratings": ["5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "4 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "4 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "4 Stars", "5 Stars", "4 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "4 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "3 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "1 Star", "5 Stars", "4 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "4 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "NaN Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "4 Stars", "5 Stars", "1 Star", "5 Stars", "3 Stars", "0 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "4 Stars", "5 Stars", "4 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "4 Stars", "4 Stars", "4 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars"]}, "/trail/canada/nova-scotia/johnson-river-falls-trail": {"written": ["2km in - some wet spots but.

Without that knowledge we may not have found it as there are 2 separate forks in the road. The marked trail will lead you right to the falls!\nAfter the 4 wheel trail turns into a walking trail it becomes a bit overgrown with blueberry bushes but nothing extreme. My 8 year old hiked it with ease. Well worth the hike to get to the waterfall! \nIt had just down poured the last 2 days so there\u2019s some big puddles to maneuver around but the falls were roaring!! Spectacular!\nLots of horse flies! Bring bug spray and a hat", "Giving 4 stars based on the type of trail - gravel roadway giving way to a woodsy trail that ends at a very pretty waterfall. This was an easy walk in, pleasant on a cooler day as there is little shade. As everyone has mentioned - garbage - but it is only in a few spots. The horseflies were terrible so we were glad to have worn long sleeves and pants. Also glad to have downloaded the map as recommended - there are quite a few different trails but the one marked takes you right to the falls. We couldn\u2019t figure out the loop around the falls, crossed the river and followed the tape for a bit but when we lost that trail we went back the way we came. Some nice wildflowers, lots of birds and chipmunks", "Bring sunscreen and bug spray.", "decent trail leads to some beautiful scenic areas. actual foot path portion of the trail is a little over grown but easy to follow. \n\nas noted previously, the trail starts as an access road, moves onto a fairly wide atv trail, followed by a single file path through the bush.   \n\nlots of horseflys about and buzzing our heads and arms. they were very annoying. \n\nto note: a number of random places along the atv trails where inconsiderate people have dumped garbage.", "Loved it. Over half is on a service/ATV road, then through a path in the woods, overgrown but still can see where it goes. I recommend downloading the map to have for back up as I took a quick wrong turn once or twice as its not marked. \n\n60 minutes in and out. Spent about 20 minutes outside of that just at the falls letting my dog swim.", "It was kind of dried out when I went (despite it raining for a few days). The path is full of frogs, and some small snakes. Overgrown and slightly thorny, you\u2019re going to need pants. Probably more worth it in the fall", "Trail was not bad. Starts off as a service road for the natural gas pipeline, turns off on to an ATV trail. Multiple forks, all seem to still eventually lead to the waterfall. Waterfall is great.   A lot of garbage in a couple spots on the trail. Wish I had an effective means to remove it.", "Gorgeous waterfall and a fairly quick hike. The trail isn\u2019t super well marked - for the forks, we went 1) right 2) straight/left 3) straight/left. A previous commenter said to stay right until the end but when we went right at the second fork, we were headed way off course. There is a lot of household garbage dumped at the beginning of the trail - it\u2019s honestly a bit shocking to see big pieces of furniture, old paint cans, etc.... It took us about 25 mins each way, with a dog and a child. It was very buggy at the waterfall.", "It definitely was a super hot day to attempt this trail.\n\nBut I did it. I do suggest using the map to follow the trail. It makes it really easy to navigate to the fall.\n\nIt took me about 25 mins to walk to the falls, and about 25 mins around the falls for pictures and 25 back out!\n\na lot of the trail is open to the sun, with a few areas that are shaded.", "good trail for ATV not so much for walking ", "Not great, multiple trails not super clear paths. Lots of garbage on the trail. Nice waterfall", "My favourite trail by far! Certainly capable of any skill level until you reach the actual falls, then it\u2019s quite a steep climb down. We followed advice from previous reviews to keep the app out so we could track our whereabouts - the trail is not marked at all and you will come to several forks in the road. We got lucky and found the falls our first time! It\u2019s a gorgeous spot with flat land and shallow water access for camping or picnics. Our dogs loved it! There is a large gravel opening half way through the trail where there is lots of garbage from other campers, which was disappointing to see. Horseflies and ticks were HORRIBLE, but the waterfall was worth it! About 40 mins both ways. Beautiful views but some muddy spots after it rained day before. Bring sunscreen as most of the trail is in open sun. Watch your step for fallen logs and vines. All I can say for directions is stay far right at every fork except when you come to a grassy hill incline, stay straight -but you\u2019ll hear the water by then! Loved it here.", "I would suggest using the app to find your way since there are a lot of side trails. A fair amount of it is just gravel road but the further you get it turned in the more single track. Very scenic when you get to the waterfall I highly suggest this hike", "4.5 stars. Only missing a half star because of the garbage and spilled oil everywhere at the first half of the trail. Second half is fantastic, not many bugs, the waterfall is great. It should be noted that the trail does continue after its marked on alltrails, it will lead you down to soldier lake which is a nice spot for a picnic. Would recommend!", "Like others have said I started down the wrong trail to start but used the map, double backed and found the right one. Once in the trail it was easy to follow!\nLots of garbage around which is a shame.\nNice waterfall at the end!", "If you\u2019re going to do this hike, make sure that your phone has data so you can follow this map. There\u2019s a lot of forks in the road so it\u2019s good to have the map on so you know which way to go. I\u2019d say it took about 30 minutes to get to the falls and about 20 minutes to get pack to the car...After you do it once, you may not need the map but it definitely saved my life. Beautiful waterfall!! ", "easy to moderate hike, follow the red markers, not hard to follow. beautiful falls at the end", "Awesome trail. I took advice of other reviews and found it easy to navigate with the map. Great spot!", "Nice hike , definitely tricky to navigate if you aren\u2019t following the map because there\u2019s lots of forks . We made it to the falls, was a nice reward", "bit tricky to navigate through all the twists and turns of the dirt bike tracks so just keep an eye on the map. Saw a pheasant but otherwise not a lot of wildlife spotting. as others have said unfortunately people have dumped household garbage around the trails. Waterfall is really beautiful though :) ", "A lot of garbage and waterfall isn\u2019t easy to access", "great hike! ended with some very muddy shoes. unfortunately a lot of garbage \n", "The trail is meh right now since the greenery hasn\u2019t come in yet, but the waterfall at the end is very nice. The first bit of the trail is a road, then it turns into an ATV route. I will mirror the comment below, at one point the ATV route goes right and you need to continue straight to hit the waterfall so keep an eye on your maps!", "The trail forked and we wound up taking the wrong path so we didn't make it to the falls but it did lead us to a beautiful lake. early season so it was very muddy and lots of ATVs out digging trenches into the path. we're definitely going to go back and hike on the right trail though. ", "Full train information can be found in Benoit Lalonde's book \"Waterfalls of Nova Scotia\"\r\n\r\nFirst quarter of the trial is on a dirt road. Unfortunately people have elected to use the road as a place to dump household items in a few locations. The remainder or the trail is through a clear cut, that was likely cut more than a dozen years ago. The trail through the clear cut follows the rough roads used for logging machinery. I notice red flagging tape through the clear cut portion of the train. The scenery is unremarkable and the waterfall is not a scenic as others in the book."], "key_words": [["Hiking", "Rocky"], ["OHV/Off-road driving"], ["Mountain biking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"],

I started loudly explaining as she was getting closer, i was scared, her dog was growling, bit at my pack and barking and knocking me over. when she got to me, she shooed the dog forward, quipped a little sorry without looking at me and ran off. I was shaken up pretty bad. I love dogs, owned many, but this was terrifying. I've never been faced with a dog that aggressive before. had to drop and regulate a bit but shaken for the rest of the walk. if you have a dog with this potential keep them attached to you! this was a dogs on leash trail.

Simply go to youtu.be/PxGNBHnov-I\r\n\r\nIt was a fun day, and it would be great to share my experience with you!\r\n\r\nLong Lake Provincial Park is a short 10-15 minute drive from the city. Located near a subdivision, this is a popular spot to visit. Since this place is close to the city, they did make sure to ensure ample parking. \r\n\r\nThere are several trails from the parking lot (one goes right, and one goes left). We ended up going left during our trip. The paths are well maintained and follow the lake. I found as though the trail intersections could have been better labelled, as we had a bit of an issue finding the correct one back to the car. \r\n\r\nYou can access the lake in several different spots where you can swim if you'd like. The only ones in the lake when I was there were a couple of doggie friends! \r\n\r\nThere is no admission, and as far as I'm aware, no services - including no washrooms. \r\n\r\nTrails are easy\r\n\r\nHope this was helpful, and I hope you check out the video to get a better sense of this park!", "This Trail is part of the Long Lake Provincial Park, it is an upgraded trail for all users.

My dog and I have had our share of scares and close calls with other dogs which are walking off leash in on leash areas. Very frustrating. And yes, there are people who don't pick up after their dogs or pick it up and leave the bag on the trail for someone else to take out.
